<p>The forms on your website can help you gather your customers, suppliers, or partners’ data. You can create different forms using the <strong>Forms</strong> application. You can create simple forms your customers use to send you a message, such as <em>Contact Us</em>. After they submit, they can see a short personalized “Thank you” message on the live site. Or, you can build forms that trigger more complex logic, such as sending a customer a “Thank you” autoresponder email or even automatically subscribing them to a newsletter.</p>
