<p>Learn how to create a new form from scratch and add the form fields, adjusting them to create smooth user experience.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the <strong>Forms</strong> application, select <strong>New form</strong> to open the <em>Form builder</em>.</li>
<li>Use the (<strong>+</strong>) plus button in the middle of the form filed and add a field of your choice.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Configure</strong> button to adjust field’s properties:
<ol type="1">
<li>
<strong>Label</strong> is the description shown before the field (e.g. “First name”). Adjust it as needed so your contacts know what data they are supposed to provide.</li>
<li>Tick the <strong>Required</strong> checkbox if customers have to provide value to this field before they submit the online form.</li>
<li>The <strong>Name</strong> is a unique identifier of the form field. Set the Name value only when you create the form and do not change it.
<ol type="1">
<li>Change the <em>Name</em> only when you create the form. If you change the name later, it might cause problems with the form’s functionality.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Modify other field properties to give a hint or clarify any additional requirements:
<ol type="1">
<li>
<strong>Default value</strong> is a pre-filled value in the field, the contact can follow with their input.</li>
<li>
<strong>Explanation text</strong> shows under the field in smaller font size and can be used as a more detailed description of the field.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tooltip</strong> will appear when a contact hovers their mouse over the field.</li>
<li>
<strong>Placeholder</strong> shows in the field as a text in a lighter color that disappears when your contact adds any value into the field.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Similarly, add further fields you want to include into your online form.</li>
<li>If necessary, reorder the fields within the form by dragging-and-dropping the components using the purple ribbon.</li>
<li>Switch to the <strong>General</strong> tab and update your form’s <strong>Name</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on your website implementation, you might also be able to group forms fields into sections to give the whole group of fields some pre-defined behavior. For example, you can add a title to your form section or show form fields distributed into two columns. To adjust the layout of your form, select <strong>Change section type</strong> on the field banner. To add a new form section, use the (+) plus button on the side.</p>
