<p>Knowing how your visitors navigate and what content they consume through your digital content brings you invaluable insights for defining and optimizing your customer journeys.</p>
<p>Xperience’s <em>Contact activity tracking</em> feature allows you to <strong>track and analyze</strong> how contacts engage with your website, including <strong>browsing patterns</strong>, <strong>content consumption</strong>, <strong>form submissions</strong>, <strong>downloads</strong>, and other activities.</p>
<p>Xperience tracks contacts <strong>based on a cookie</strong>. Once the contact agrees with the tracking, Xperience will always try to <strong>match and log all activities</strong> done by a specific contact, even when the contact performs the activity on a different device (such as visiting the website on their desktop and mobile phone).</p>
<p>Depending on a cookie that represents a current contact, Xperience doesn’t require any further unique identification, such as a contact’s email. As a result, the system can log the activities of <strong>“anonymous” visitors</strong> and identify them later, for example, <strong>when they share their email addresses</strong> with you via a <strong>form</strong>.</p>
<p>You can view the collected contact data in the <strong>Contact management</strong> application. Xperience displays all activities on the website in the <strong>Activities</strong> section. When opening individual contacts, you can see you can see their activities.</p>
<p>With the Xperience <strong>Cross-site tracking</strong> feature, you generate an Xperience tracking script, insert it into your third-party website - and you can start collecting your website’s visitor data, even on websites that haven’t been built with Xperience. Creating an overall <strong>picture of your customer’s interactions in one system</strong> opens new opportunities to personalize your marketing experience.</p>

<p>The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection">Data protection</a> functionality helps you <strong>stay within the legal boundaries</strong> of different data protection regulations in marketing-related actions. <strong>Developers can prepare data protection</strong> on your website in different ways. Usually, Xperience will use the contact’s email address as a unique identifier.</p>

<h2 id="exercise---tracking-a-contact-in-xperience">Exercise - Tracking a contact in Xperience</h2>
<p>This exercise will give you hands-on experience with the contact tracking feature. You’ll impersonate a website visitor using an incognito window, private window, or another browser and see how Xperience by Kentico collects visitor data in the <strong>Contact management</strong> application.</p>
<p> <strong>Task</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the <strong>Contact management</strong> application in the Xperience administration in one window and your live site in a second, incognito window. (You can copy the whole application URL, open a new incognito window tab, paste in the URL, and remove everything starting from /<em>admin</em>/ to the end. Your adjusted URL with only a website homepage URL will look like this, for example, <em>https://us-03.kenticolab.com/Hosted_Kbank_12345</em> .)</p></li>
<li><p>In the incognito window, consent to tracking using the <strong>Accept all</strong> button in the consent banner.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the Xperience administration and go to the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab to refresh your contact list in the <strong>Contact management</strong> application.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>Created</strong> column header in the contacts list to reorder your existing contacts from newest to oldest.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the newest contact. This new contact’s name is <em>Anonymous - (timestamp)</em>; for example, <em>Anonymous - 2022-08-23 04:45:06.775</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <strong>Activities</strong> button below the contact’s <strong>Overview</strong> to see the list of activities the contact has performed on the website.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Perform some activities in the incognito window for your contact. Here are some examples: Visit the <em>News</em> listing page, the <em>Want more space?</em> article, and <em>Loans</em> page, and submit a form on the <em>Contact</em> page.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Switch between the live site in the incognito window and the administration while performing these activities. See the <strong>Overview</strong> in your contact’s profile. Then, go back to the <strong>Activities</strong> tab to view the collected data. Watch how Xperience tracks activities in real time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>When you finish browsing your website in the incognito window, switch to the contact’s <strong>Overview</strong> tab. If you have submitted the form on the <em>Contact</em> page, your demo contact will no longer be anonymous.</p></li>
