<title>Manage files in Xperience</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You can manage all your digital files within Xperience by Kentico. This guide will teach you the basics of working with files in Xperience to make managing your digital files more straightforward and effective.</p>
<p>In Xperience, you can store various file types, including images, videos, PDFs, presentations, documents, and other assets. All assets are stored within the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">Content hub</a>, your central repository for managing marketing content. The assets in the <em>Content hub</em> are based on a custom <a href="/guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide/what-is-a-content-type">content type</a> <em>Asset</em> or <em>Media</em> and their names differ from project to project. For example, in the Kbank demo site, you’ll work with the <strong>Asset</strong> content type.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="work-with-assets-in-content-hub">Work with assets in Content hub</h2>
<p>Storing files in <em>Content hub</em> makes it reuse them in different digital marketing activities across your marketing <a href="/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-channels/digital-marketing-channels">channels</a>. Assets in the <em>Content hub</em> give provide you with helpful features that make managing large projects a breeze.</p>
<p>You can switch the view mode in the <em>Content hub</em> to preview all content items based on the <em>Asset</em> content type.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you need to add multiple files to the <em>Content hub</em> at once, use the <strong>Upload files</strong> button.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To ensure no approved data is published live, you can apply different <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/workflows">content management workflows</a>. You can fully control who on your team and how they use assets through <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces">workspace</a>.</p>
<p>You can also create asset variants for different languages to ensure that your visitors receive properly <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">localized content</a>, and use <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies">taxonomies</a> to categorize your images accordingly.</p>
<p>Xperience also provides an out-of-the-box method to <em>restrict access</em> to the file, meaning only logged-in visitors can view or access it.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="image-ai-features">Image AI features</h2>
<p>Xperience <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/aira-configuration">AIRA</a> provides additional features when it comes to images stored in the <em>Content hub</em>. It can adjust images when you upload them automatically. For example, it creates different versions of the same image for desktops and mobile phones. This ensures that your audience sees the best version of your image, no matter what device they are using. You can even adjust your image or set up a focal point to crop the image appropriately.</p>
<p>You will learn more about Xperience’s digital marketing capabilities on another page of this tutorial. And see how developers define the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content type assets</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-content-items">retrieve their content</a> to the website.</p>

<p><strong>Media libraries sunset</strong></p>
<p>Media libraries have been officially sunset, and their related API members have been marked as obsolete. Support for media libraries will continue for one more year (until July 24, 2026), after which the feature and all associated APIs will be completely removed.</p>
<p>See <a href="/guides/architecture/media-libraries-migration-guidance">Media library migration</a> for instructions on how to migrate your media library files to <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">Content hub</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Second, a less convenient and somewhat legacy approach to storing files in Xperience is to keep them as <em>media library files</em>. <strong>Media libraries</strong> application was used in previous Kentico versions because they didn’t have the <em>Content hub</em> application. Similarly to <em>Content hub</em>, you can store different file types such as images, sound files, videos, or package files.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly to assets in the <em>Content hub</em>, you can use files stored in a media library on your website pages. For example, you can create a <em>Campaign assets</em> library, keep all the campaign-related content within, and reuse it on campaign landing pages or personalized widgets.</p>
<p>Unlike assets, media library files have only a predefined set of fields, and customizing them will require substantial developer resources. Also, unlike assets, you cannot secure access to media library files. These files will always be accessible at their direct URL by their GUID (e.g., <em>example.com/getmedia/4ff39fec-c55a-4456-8733-f89c8e79b652/family-in-mountains-valey_1.jpg</em>)</p>
