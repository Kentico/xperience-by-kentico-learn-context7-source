<p>Content is your number one digital marketing asset. Using it effectively stands at the core of managing digital experiences.</p>
<p>Xperience by Kentico can serve as a repository for all your digital marketing content. Xperience applications can power different marketing activities, from sharing business information and increasing brand awareness to promoting new services on campaign pages.</p>
<p>The <strong>Content management essentials</strong> will teach you about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content and content types in Xperience.</li>
<li>Applications you use to manage your content.</li>
<li>Different digital marketing channels in Xperience.</li>
<li>Editing content in Xperience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="content-in-xperience">Content in Xperience</h2>
<p>Xperience by Kentico is a highly customizable solution that helps marketing teams achieve their goals. Commonly, one Xperience by Kentico implementation differs from another. Marketers have different ways of managing their content. They will use other tools to create marketing campaigns or share content on various channels. Depending on their business requirement, they will leverage integrations with different solutions.</p>

<p>Say a company hires you to run digital marketing in their application built on Xperience by Kentico because of your previous experience with this platform.</p>
<p>If different agencies implemented the applications, the new and the old applications might contain various features. For example, the content types might completely differ. Alternatively, similar content types will have additional properties, such as <em>Article</em>, which might have different editing fields or available properties. Each website will also contain other <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/widgets-and-page-builder">widgets</a> that dictate how to work with content in the new Xperience application.</p>
</div>

<p>However, no matter the implementation, several things stay the same.</p>
<h3 id="your-content-is-based-on-a-content-type">Your content is based on a content type</h3>
<p>You can imagine a <em>content type</em> as a cookie cutter for every <em>content item</em>. As you can create cookies of the same shape with one cookie cutter, editors use one content type and make the items with the same characteristics. The <em>content type</em> defines what data you’ll input and how Xperience displays this data across different channels, such as websites, emails, or app screens.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, the <em>Article</em> content type allows you to create any number of articles that will always have the same properties.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly, if your <em>Featured content</em> content type contains a <em>Title</em>, <em>Short description</em>, and <em>Asset/Media</em> fields, every individual content item created with this content type will have the same properties.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Content types define the content model that defines the structure and relationships between the <em>content types</em>. As an editor, you’ll work with types your developers prepare. If you realize some content types don’t suffice or identify where you can improve your editing workflow, you can ask your developers to enhance your content types.</p>

<p>You can learn more about how you can store and present the data in Xperience applications by seeing <a href="/guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide">Content modeling</a> guide in the documentation. (Please note that the linked guide covers the topic from a more technical perspective.)</p>

<h2 id="types-of-content-in-xperience">Types of content in Xperience</h2>
<p>You can classify marketing content from different perspectives. Let’s simplify this topic for this tutorial and say that in Xperience, you’ll work with two types of content: <strong>structured and unstructured</strong>.</p>
<p>What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>Structured content</strong> (or structured data) is data without any information on what this piece of information will look like when it’s displayed to consumers. Since every <a href="/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-channels/digital-marketing-channels">digital marketing channel</a> has different data display requirements, storing data in structured format makes your content <strong>reusable</strong>. <strong>Unstructured content</strong> stores the data and information about what the data will look like which ties the content to a specific marketing channel.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we’ll discuss these two options in Xperience. To learn more about types of content, see the <a href="/guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide/structured-and-unstructured-content">Content modeling guide</a>.</p>
