<p>Users represent individual user accounts that can be accessed in the system with their own credentials. Anytime a user reaches out that they need to change something in their profile or a team lead wants you to add a new team member to your Xperience application, follow along to find your way around the Xperience <strong>Users</strong> application.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-or-edit-a-user">How to create or edit a user</h2>

<div>

</div>
<div>
To create a new user, you must have Xperience configured to send transactional emails.
</div>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to the <strong>Users</strong> application.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>New user</strong>, fill in their information, and <strong>save</strong> the changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you create a new user, Xperience sends them a confirmation email with a link to create their password.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You can change other users’ credentials as an <em>administrator</em> with appropriate permissions. Find the user in the <strong>Users</strong> application and update their profile.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the user’s general information and <strong>roles</strong>, or activate or deactivate the user.</p></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h2 id="how-to-update-your-password">How to update your password</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the application dashboard, locate the <strong>User menu</strong> (bottom-left button).</li>
<li>Go to your personal <strong>Account</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Password</strong> tab and change your password.</li>
<li>
<strong>Save</strong> your changes.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h2 id="create-a-user">Create a user</h2>
<p>Suppose a new digital marketer starts working for your company next week. Create a new user, assign them the role of <em>Digital Channel Marketer</em>, and email them an invitation.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Xperience sends invitations to new users, so you need to have Email-sending functionality configured. See our <a href="https://devnet.kentico.com/CMSPages/DocLinkMapper.ashx?version=xp&amp;link=smtp_servers_config" target="_blank">Email configuration</a> documentation to learn how to set up email sending.</p>
<p>If sending emails fails in your live project, you can retrieve the invitation link from the notification. You can find the notification in the <strong>Email queue</strong> application.</p>
</div>

<p> <strong>Task</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to the <strong>Users</strong> application.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <strong>New user</strong>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Add information about the user:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<strong>New user email</strong>: <em>lauram@kbank.com.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Role</strong>: <em>Digital Channel Manager.</em>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Send</strong> the invitation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Your Xperience demo website doesn’t send any invitations for this exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>To see the invitation email, go to the <strong>Email queue</strong> application and find the user’s email in the <strong>To</strong> column, with the subject: “<em>You have been invited to join</em>…”.</li>
<li>The <strong>email’s body contains a link</strong> to help you finish the new user’s registration.</li>
<li>Open the link in a new anonymous browser tab, create a password for the user, and <strong>Sign up</strong>. (Using an anonymous tab prevents Xperience from switching into this newly created user account from the <em>Global Administrator</em> you use in your main browser.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you sign in as the user you’ve created, you will see only the applications with assigned permissions on the dashboard.</p>

<p>Users and roles are an essential part of Xperience by Kentico administration. By setting them up, you can help everyone focus on their daily jobs.</p>
