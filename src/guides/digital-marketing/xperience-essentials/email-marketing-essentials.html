<p>Email marketing can promote your services or products and help you stay in touch with your customers. Xperience allows you to create the following types of emails:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Regular</strong> emails for subscribed recipients.</li>
<li>
<strong>Form autoresponders</strong> are sent automatically after a visitor submits a form.</li>
<li>
<strong>Confirmation</strong> emails that notify recipients when they successfully subscribe or unsubscribe from email marketing.</li>
</ul>
