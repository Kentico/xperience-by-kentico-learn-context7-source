<p>Today, website visitors expect to get what they come for instantly. If they aren’t satisfied, they leave. As a marketer, you no longer manage just the content of the website, you manage the whole digital experience your visitors and customers get when they interact with your brand. This leads to the emergence of digital experience platforms, in short, DXPs.</p>

<h3>What is a DXP?</h3>
<p>A digital experience platform (DXP) helps you create, manage, deliver, and personalize your customers’ digital experiences.</p>
<p>Rather than a collection of different services that marketers use independently from one another, a DXP integrates different technologies you can use to analyze your customers’ interactions with your brand across different channels and customize their digital experiences.
