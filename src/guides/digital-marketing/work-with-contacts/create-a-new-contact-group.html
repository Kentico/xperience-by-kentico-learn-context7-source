<title>Create a new contact group</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>See how to create a new group of contacts and how to work with group conditions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Contact groups</strong> application.</li>
<li>Create a <strong>New contact group</strong>.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>Name</strong> of the group. We recommend using clear, concise, and descriptive names to identify the segment among other groups in the administration interface.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>Code name</strong>. This serves as a unique identifier used in macros.</li>
<li>Add a short <strong>Description</strong> so everybody on the team knows the group’s purpose.</li>
<li>Use <strong>Add condition</strong> button to create condition rules. Xperience adds all contacts that match the conditions to the contact group.</li>
</ol>

<p>Xperience allows you to create contact groups using complex sets of conditions. You can organize these rules into units and determine these groups’ relationships. That’s why we recommend - for more complex filtering scenarios - to specify the conditions “on paper” before you start defining them in Xperience.</p>
<p>You can choose between <strong>Add another condition</strong> or <strong>Add another group</strong> when creating your conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you choose to <strong>Add another condition</strong> to existing conditions, you create a single unit of conditions where all rules are evaluated together.
<ul>
<li>For example (Unit 1): <em>Contact is from country: USA</em> AND <em>Contact has submitted a form: Loan Form</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you <strong>Add another group</strong> of conditions, you create a new unit.
<ul>
<li>For example (Unit 2): <em>Contact is from country: Australia</em> AND <em>Contact has submitted a form: Mortgage application</em>.</li>
<li>Xperience allows you also to evaluate the relationship between units using logical operators AND or OR.
<ul>
<li>For example, see the logical operator OR between unit 1 and unit 2. Thanks to the OR operator, contact will be included in the group when either of these units is evaluated as true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
