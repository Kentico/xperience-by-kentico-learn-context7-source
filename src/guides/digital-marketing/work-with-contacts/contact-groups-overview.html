<body>
<p>Contact groups in Xperience are segments created from contacts in your database. You define the sorting conditions when you create a new group using Xperience’s visual condition builder. Once a contact fulfills these conditions, Xperience automatically adds them to the respective groups. Or, if needed, you can add or remove criteria in an existing contact group.</p>
<p>Xperience automatically checks if a new or updated contact fulfills the contact group’s conditions and adds or removes the contact accordingly. Any single contact can also belong to any number of different contact groups.</p>
<p>For example, your contact can fall into a contact group that collects <em>frequent product buyers</em>, a second group of <em>newsletter subscribers</em>, and a third group that includes all visitors <em>who have visited specific pages but have yet to submit an online form</em> on those pages.</p>
