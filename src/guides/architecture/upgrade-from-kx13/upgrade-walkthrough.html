<title>Walk through the upgrade step-by-step</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In our guides about the <strong>Kentico Xperience 13 (KX13)</strong> to <strong>Xperience by Kentico (XbyK)</strong> solution upgrade, we talked about a <a href="/guides/architecture/upgrade-from-kx13/upgrade-from-kx13-overview">conceptual overview</a> of the process and <a href="/guides/architecture/upgrade-from-kx13/plan-your-strategy-for-migrating-features">capability comparison</a> between the two products. Then we dove deeper into <a href="/guides/architecture/upgrade-from-kx13/prep-for-upgrade-and-transfer-data">preparing your environment</a> for the upgrade using the <em>Kentico migration tool</em>, and outlined <a href="/guides/architecture/upgrade-from-kx13/adjust-your-code-and-adapt">the next steps after data migration</a>.</p>
<p>This walkthrough goes a step further, <strong>demonstrating the upgrade hands-on</strong> using our <em>Dancing Goat sample site</em>. Follow along to see how you can quickly get website pages from KX13 up and running in XbyK without redesign or frontend development costs just by running the data migration and adjusting how the data is handled on the backend.</p>
