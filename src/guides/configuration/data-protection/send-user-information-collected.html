<p>To test this scenario on the demo website, you need to first generate sample data for GDPR.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <strong>Configuration</strong> → <strong>Sample data generator</strong> and use the <strong>Generate sample data</strong> button. You can then also imitate the contact’s behavior to get more realistic data. Visit your sample website in an incognito window and:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<strong>Agree</strong> with the tracking consent.</li>
<li>Visit several pages using the navigation menu.</li>
<li>Submit the form on the Contacts page.</li>
<li>Optional: To test deleting membership:</li>
<li>Use the user button in the top-right corner register on the website.</li>
<li>Supply any email and password, for example, <a href="mailto:test@demo.local">test@demo.local</a> and password as a member to test deleting the member object.</li>
</ol>
<p>Test the scenario with the email of the contact you have imitated previously or the following email: <a href="mailto:Name-20.Generated.Surname-20@localhost.local">Name-20.Generated.Surname-20@localhost.local</a>.</p>
