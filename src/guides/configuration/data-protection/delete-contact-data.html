<p>To test this scenario on the <a href="https://www.kentico.com/services/training/training-website-requests" target="_blank">demo website</a>, you need to first generate sample data for GDPR.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Configuration</strong> → <strong>Sample data generator</strong> and use the <strong>Generate sample data</strong> button. You can then also imitate the contact’s behavior to get more realistic data.  Visit your sample website in an incognito window and:</li>
<li>
<strong>Agree</strong> with the tracking consent.</li>
<li>Visit several pages using the navigation menu.</li>
<li>Submit the form on the Contacts page.</li>
<li>
<em>Optional</em>: To test deleting membership:
<ol type="1">
<li>Use the user button in the top-right corner to register on the website.</li>
<li>Supply any email and password, for example, <a href="mailto:test@demo.local">test@demo.local</a> and password as a member to test deleting the member object.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Test the scenario with the email of the contact you have imitated previously or the following email: <a href="mailto:Name-20.Generated.Surname-20@localhost.local">Name-20.Generated.Surname-20@localhost.local</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s common for developers to prepare a special page that allows your members to request getting this data automatically. Usually, this data is available within the member account profile or on the customer preference center. To learn what data the company has gathered about the user, they must sign into their profile and verify their request, e.g., via email.</p>
