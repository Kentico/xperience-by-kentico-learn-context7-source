<title>Set up your Xperience Portal</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2 id="first-time-sign-in">First time sign-in</h2>
<p>When Kentico creates your Xperience Portal instance, the person assigned as the <strong>Primary contact</strong> for your project (as agreed before your Xperience Portal instance creation) will receive an email invitation.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>The <strong>Primary contact</strong> also has the role of <strong>Tenant Administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>There can be <strong>multiple Tenant administrators</strong> but <strong>only one Primary contact</strong> for each project.</p>
</div>

<p>After the Primary contact sets up their password and multi-factor authentication (MFA), they can add other users to the project, who will also receive an email invitation.</p>
<p>Follow <a href="/guides/configuration/saas/get-started-with-saas#sign-in-to-xperience-portal">these steps</a> to set up your account.</p>
<p>Upon successful sign in to the Xperience Portal, click <strong>Accept</strong> to join the project you were invited to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The system will then navigate you to the Xperience Portal <strong>Dashboard</strong> screen.</p>
<h2 id="identify-the-active-project">Identify the active project</h2>
<p>It is possible that during your time working with the Xperience Portal, you will be a part of several projects. Here’s how you can identify that you are working on the correct one.</p>
<p>Notice the project selector in the top-left. If you have access to more than one project, you can switch between them. When collapsed, it indicates the project you are currently working on.</p>
<p>Another way to identify a project is by looking at the <strong>Project info</strong> panel, which shows the project name, the GUID, expiration date, and the hash string salt. We will utilize these values later in this series.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="explore-the-users-and-roles">Explore the users and roles</h2>
<p>Navigate to the <strong>Users</strong> screen. Here you can see everyone participating in your current project and their <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal/reference-xperience-portal-user-roles">roles</a>.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>The crown icon next to a Tenant administrator role indicates who the Primary contact for the project is.</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<p>If your role has sufficient permissions, you can invite more users to the project or change their roles.</p>
<p>Read about the <a href="/guides/configuration/saas/get-started-with-saas#users-in-xperience-portal">different user roles in Xperience Portal here</a>. Find detailed information about role permissions in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal/reference-xperience-portal-user-roles">our documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="create-your-personal-access-token">Create your personal access token</h2>
<p>You will need a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#personal-access-tokens">personal access token (PAT)</a> to upload a deployment package using the Xperience Portal API later in this series. Let’s create one.</p>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Personal access tokens → My tokens</strong> and click <strong>Create token</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fill out the <strong>Display name</strong> and the <strong>Expiration date</strong> to fit your project needs.</p>
<p>Check the <strong>Deploy to QA</strong> checkbox under <strong>Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After you click <strong>Create</strong>, the system will show you the generated token.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>This is the only time you will be able to access your token value. Make sure to copy and store the PAT in a secure location BEFORE clicking OK.</strong></p>
</div>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="set-up-notifications">Set up notifications</h2>
<p>As a technical user, you likely want to receive alerts about technical issues with your environment (e.g., a failed deployment, DDoS attack, etc.). Xperience portal sends such notifications via email and allows each user to set their notification preferences using the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.</p>
<p>By default, all notifications are enabled. Since every team has a slightly different distribution of responsibilities, we encourage you to give these settings extra thought to tweak them according to your needs.</p>
<p>Our recommendation for technical users is to have at least <strong>all <em>Error</em> and <em>Critical</em> alerts on the environment they are responsible for</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="update-maintenance-schedule---optional">Update maintenance schedule - optional</h2>
<p>In your own project you may want to consider rescheduling the maintenance window.</p>
<p>For more information of what the maintenance involves and how it affects your project, visit <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#schedule-maintenance-of-xperience-portal-projects">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>For this example, let’s leave the schedule as is.</p>
