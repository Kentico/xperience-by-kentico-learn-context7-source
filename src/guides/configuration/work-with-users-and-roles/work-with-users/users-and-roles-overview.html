<h3 id="users-and-roles-overview">Users and roles overview</h3>
<p>Users log in daily to your website’s administration interface and create new articles, personalize content for different audiences, build new online forms, or monitor the system’s performance. </p>
<p><strong>Users</strong> in Xperience by Kentico work with the applications from the back end - they create content, define marketing activities, etc. A typical user, for example, adds website articles or creates personalized content variants.</p>
<p>Administrators create different <strong>roles</strong> to define user <strong>permissions</strong> and access to applications.</p>
<p>You can assign one role to more users. For example, you can have several users with a <em>Content editor</em> role that can add or edit articles and other website pages or update content across the website.</p>
<p>Administrators can also assign multiple roles to the same user. Permissions granted within each role are cumulative. For example, if a user has a <em>Content editor</em> role and a <em>Digital marketer</em> role, permissions from both roles apply.</p>
<p>Admins assign these <em>roles</em> to users, such as marketers, editors, and data protection officers. </p>
<p>Visitors who create their accounts in your application are called <strong>members</strong>. Unlike <em>Users</em> who can access the Xperience administration, <em>members</em> can access only the front-facing part of your application, such as a website. They can browse pages or access member-only sections of the website.</p>
