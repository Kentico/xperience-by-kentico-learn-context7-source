<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>The Xperience platform is split into different <strong><em>applications</em></strong> . You’ll have access to different applications depending on your project’s implementation.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, an application is a group of related functions you can use to perform different tasks. For example, you segment your audience in <strong>Contact groups</strong>, manage user accounts in <strong>Users</strong>, or view various information in the <strong>Event log</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="administration-interface-url-structure">Administration interface URL structure</h2>
<p>You can open applications from the dashboard or application list, and bookmark the URLs.</p>
<p>The URL of the Xperience administration interface consists of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base URL: &lt;domain&gt;/admin/ (opens the administration dashboard itself).</li>
<li>Applications in URL: &lt;domain&gt;/admin/&lt;application name&gt;/&lt;application-specific parameter&gt;
<ul>
<li>For example, <strong>Forms</strong> application’s URL contains <em>/list</em> parameter, while the <strong>Contact management</strong> application’s URL contains <em>/contacts</em> parameter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="time-in-the-administration">Time in the administration</h2>
<p>All time values in the administration are displayed in the local time zone of each user. For example: <em>01:30 PM (GMT+02:00)</em></p>
<p>The time zone is detected according to the browser and environment settings of the user’s device.</p>
