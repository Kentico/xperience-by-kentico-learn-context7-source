<title>Campaigns, or the engine driving customer journeys</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Marketing campaigns don’t just create noise – they create movement. They help prospects take meaningful steps forward in their decision-making process. That’s why campaigns are more than just isolated marketing activities – they are the engine <strong>powering progression of a customer along the customer journey</strong>.</p>

<div>
<p>While our <strong>Customer journeys</strong> feature is designed to provide strategic visibility into how customers move across touchpoints, the upcoming <strong>Campaigns</strong> feature will bring <strong>tactical execution to that vision</strong>. Together, they’ll form a powerful toolkit for modern marketers – helping you understand intent, respond to needs, and drive conversions at every stage of the journey.</p>

<h2 id="marketing-automation-meets-journey-mapping">Marketing automation meets journey mapping</h2>
<p>What is the role of campaigns in accelerating the customer journey? <em>Customer journeys</em> give you the <strong>map</strong>, and <strong>report the position</strong> of real-life customers represented by contacts, marketing campaigns give you the <strong>vehicle</strong> to help them travel that road.</p>

<div>
<p>Make sure that campaign-driven activities are accurately recorded in contact profiles within Xperience by Kentico, using either built-in or custom activity types.</p>
</div>

<p>The campaigns feature acts as a dynamic companion to journey mapping by <strong>turning insights into action</strong>. Marketers can use the insights to run marketing campaigns with <strong>targeted content, personalized offers, and timely messaging across channels</strong> – all informed by the customer’s current journey stage.</p>
<p>For example, if your journey map shows a large volume of contacts stalling in the consideration stage, with campaigns you can deploy an email series, launch a remarketing ad, or trigger a webinar invitation – all tailored to re-engage those contacts and encourage the next step forward.</p>
<h2 id="use-campaigns-to-improve-drop-off-rate">Use campaigns to improve drop-off rate</h2>
<p>You may have heard: “Not every lead is ready to buy – but every lead can be nurtured.”</p>
<p>Then comes the dilemma – is the customer on the cusp of turning from an MQL to an SQL, or are they still at the beginning of their journey, thinking things over as prospects? <em>Customer journeys</em> give you the insight into how far down their journey is the customer located, and possibly when is the best timing to excite their appetite.</p>
<p>Your targeted campaign will then build on the insights provided by a well-detailed journey, and give marketers the tools to <strong>meet prospects where they are</strong>, rather than where we want them to be. Whether it’s a soft-touch brand awareness email, or a more direct product comparison download, campaigns deliver the right content at the right time.</p>
<p>When used strategically, campaigns can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warm up cold leads with helpful content</li>
<li>Re-engage previously inactive contacts</li>
<li>Move MQLs toward SQL qualification with tailored CTAs</li>
<li>Support sales with automated follow-up sequences</li>
</ul>
<p>This turns content delivery into more than just communication – it becomes a conversion mechanism closely aligned with the customer journey’s progression.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-campaigns-with-journey-phases">Connecting campaigns with journey phases</h2>
<p>There is a strategic overlap between journey mapping and campaign execution. The most effective campaigns aren’t created in isolation – they are <strong>anchored to the mapped customer journey</strong>.</p>
<p>Each stage of the customer journey demands a different type of messaging and engagement. By aligning campaigns to those stages, marketers can ensure a seamless experience for their audience. This is where strategic tagging and tracking – like UTM parameters – become essential.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>See stage</strong> campaign might focus on top-of-funnel blog content promoted via social ads.</li>
<li>A <strong>Think stage</strong> campaign could involve a gated whitepaper download with lead scoring attached.</li>
<li>A <strong>Do stage</strong> campaign might include a product demo email sequence.</li>
<li>A <strong>Care stage</strong> campaign could revolve around loyalty rewards or onboarding education.</li>
</ul>
<p>By connecting each campaign and touchpoint accordingly, marketers can see which campaign elements contribute to progression in the journey – and optimize accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="from-awareness-to-action">From awareness to action</h2>
<p>Once a contact is identified and mapped in the customer journey, they shouldn’t be left to drift. Check your customer journey and evaluate: “Is the momentum still going?” “Is a contact moving from Prospect to Lead?”, and adapt messages as the customer’s mindset evolves.</p>
<p>A contact moving from “Prospect” to “Lead”? That’s your cue to shift from thought leadership to product positioning. An MQL showing signs of intent? Time for a targeted case study or a time-sensitive webinar invite. A loyal customer slowing down engagement? A reactivation email might bring them back into the fold.</p>
<p>In essence, use insights from your journeys and effectively influence customer decisions. They give marketers a way to not only observe journeys but also to <strong>influence them in real time</strong>.</p>
