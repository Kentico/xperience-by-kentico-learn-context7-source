<body>
<p>Email Builder is a powerful, user-friendly platform where marketers can craft visually compelling emails without technical expertise. It also simplifies development, allowing teams to easily manage templates, sections, and widgets through source control, and utilizing MJML markup to avoid complicated, client-specific HTML.</p>
<p>Through configurable templates, sections, and widgets, developers can empower marketers to quickly assemble emails that align with brand standards and business goals. By deciding what aspects of each component should be configurable as properties, carefully setting content-type restrictions, and choosing the allowed widgets or sections at each level, developers decide exactly how much flexibility their marketers have in building emails.</p>
