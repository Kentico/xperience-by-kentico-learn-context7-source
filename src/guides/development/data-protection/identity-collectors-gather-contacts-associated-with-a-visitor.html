<title>Identity collectors - Gather contacts associated with a visitor</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Data protection laws such as the European Union’s GDPR often specify that visitors to a site must be able to see their personal data that has been collected, and they can request that it be removed. Identity collection is a key part of this process.</p>

<p>The example presented in this <a href="/guides/development/data-protection">Data protection guide series</a> is a <strong>valid implementation of data protection for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">Contacts</a></strong> in Xperience by Kentico.

<p>You can copy-paste the code samples into your own solution.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to do so, <strong>make sure to consult your legal team</strong> to determine whether the implementation, texts, and consent levels <strong>meet the requirements of your region and market</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-components">Understand the components</h2>
<p>In the <strong>Configuration → Data Protection</strong> application in <em>Xperience by Kentico</em>, you’ll notice tabs for <strong>Data portability</strong>, <strong>Right to access</strong>, and <strong>Right to be forgotten</strong>.</p>
<p>These correspond to aspects of the GDPR but are applicable to other regulations as well, and each is used for dealing with visitors’ personal data.</p>
<p>The <strong>Data portability</strong> tab, once implemented, allows administrators to gather a visitor’s data in a machine-readable format. In contrast, the <strong>Right to access</strong> tab collects data in a human-readable format. Finally, the <strong>Right to be forgotten</strong> tab allows a visitor’s data to be wiped from the site.</p>
<p>However, the code that carries out these actions needs to be implemented, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the virtually limitless ways a site could collect and store personal information. The code samples from this series cover just one example site with its own specific requirements.

<h2 id="identify-the-first-step">Identify the first step</h2>
<p>Data collection and erasure require an <em>Identity collector</em> as the first step.</p>
<p><em>Identity collectors</em> are used to gather a collection of Xperience objects representing the visitor, called Identities. For example, real-world people could be represented by a <em>User</em> object, one or more <em>Contact</em> objects, or any custom objects, such as <em>Customer</em>, <em>Author</em>, <em>Contractor</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Once the identity collector gathers these identities, it passes them to other components. These components can use these identities to find objects that reference them, e.g. activities performed by a contact.</p>
<p>We will cover the creation of an identity collector, the first step of this process. We will cover the creation of an identity collector, the first step of this process.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Note: The system uses identifiers, such as an email address, to find Identity objects. It is critical that any data you collect and store always contains one of the following, so that it can be found.</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference to one of the identity objects</li>
<li>the identifier itself</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider an example where you use an email address as the identifier and create a form that collects the first and last name of a visitor but no email address. In such a case, there would be no way to find that information using a supplied email address, and GDPR compliance would be impossible when a visitor exercises their <em>right to be forgotten</em>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="implement-the-identity-collector">Implement the identity collector</h2>
<p>This code sample will assume the site collects only contacts as identities — it does not account for visitors saved as <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">users</a>, <a href="/documentation/business-users/members">members</a>, or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">custom objects</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a <em>Collectors</em> folder in <em>~/Features/DataProtection</em> of the <em>TrainingGuides.Web</em> project.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a <em>ContactIdentityCollector.cs</em> file to the folder, and add a namespace matching the folder structure (<code>TrainingGuides.Web.Features.DataProtection.Collectors</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/personal-data-collection#create-the-identity-collector">example identity collector from the documentation</a>, and add it to the same namespace.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a constant to replace the hard-coded <code>“email”</code>  string, as it occurs more than once.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Define additional logic that creates a new contact with the supplied email address if the query finds none.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>It is possible for form data containing an email address to exist even if there is no contact in the database with that email. Creating this dummy contact allows the <em>Data collector</em>, which will be covered in the next part of this series, to find form data associated with the provided email address in such a case.</p>

<p>Now, Xperience will know how to utilize the <code>ContactIdentityCollector</code> class for data portability, collection, and erasure requests. When you implement a <em>Data collector</em>, covered <a href="/guides/development/data-protection/data-collectors-find-contact-personal-data#collect-data">later on in this series</a>, Xperience will use the identity collector class to gather a list of contacts and pass them to the data collector to retrieve personal data associated with them.

<p>The <code>IdentityCollectorRegister</code>, like the other data protection registers, is a queue that can contain multiple collectors. If the same class is registered to this queue more than once, it will be called multiple times.</p>
