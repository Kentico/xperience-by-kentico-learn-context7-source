<body>
<p>Welcome to the Developer Learning Map for Xperience by Kentico. This curated collection of training materials, documentation articles, and additional resources is structured to guide you through the sequential learning process tailored for developers.</p>
<p>We have put together this collection for developers working with Kentico 12 or Kentico 13 and those new to the Kentico community. These guides are organized in a recommended order to help you navigate different materials. If you are new to certain aspects of .NET framework or specific parts of Xperience by Kentico development, you will find links to resources that will prepare you before you dive into more detailed Kentico-specific information.</p>

<div>
<p>Are you a visual learner? You can find the same resources organized <a href="https://roadmap.sh/r?id=66bdc03491320df4bddcabc8" target="_blank">into a roadmap</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="xperience-development-basics">1. Xperience development basics</h2>
<p>You’ll learn the basics of application and development setup, how to leverage CI/CD processes to enhance solutions’ scalability and robustness, and how the channels work. Xperience by Kentico does not use Entity Framework but its own API layer for efficient content handling.</p>
