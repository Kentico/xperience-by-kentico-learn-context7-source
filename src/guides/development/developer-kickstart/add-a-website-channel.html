<title>Add a website channel</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The next few steps in the Kickstart series will cover the process of displaying your reusable content on a website page. Before we can create pages, we need a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a> to store them. One website channel corresponds to one site, and stores pages and their references to reusable items.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Channels and reusable content</strong></p>
<p>Xperience by Kentico supports multiple channels in one Xperience instance. There are currently three types of channels to choose from: <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">Website</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management">Headless</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management">Email</a>. You can find more details in their respective documentation pages.</p>
<p>As you saw in the <a href="/guides/development/developer-kickstart/create-a-reusable-content-type">previous step</a>, reusable items in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">Content hub</a> exist independently of channels. Editors can reference this reusable content from multiple channels at once, for example, a website and a headless channel that feeds a mobile application.</p>
