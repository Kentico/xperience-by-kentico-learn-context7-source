<p>Welcome to a kickstart of the Xperience by Kentico development!</p>
<p>Throughout this series, we’ll create and configure a simple website fully managed by Xperience by Kentico.</p>
<p>Using the MVC design pattern, you’ll build logic that displays pages managed by Xperience and a simple navigation menu. You will learn how to work with your site content (e.q., articles, products, etc.) - modeling it with <strong>content types</strong>, storing it in <strong>content items</strong>, and making it <strong>reusable</strong>.</p>
<p></p>

<p>We designed the steps to help you develop an Xperience website from scratch. You can find the complete implementation in <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kickstart" target="_blank">this repository</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>To follow along with this series, we recommend your machine has the following installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0" target="_blank">.NET 8.0</a></p></li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server 2022 (or compatible version, such as the free <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=104781" target="_blank">SQL Server Express Edition</a>)</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
The <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support" target="_blank">collation</a></strong> set for the SQL server <strong>must be case-insensitive</strong>.
</div>
</li>
<li><p>an <strong>IDE</strong> that supports ASP.NET Core development, such as <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h3>
<p>These materials assume you are familiar with the ASP.NET Core and C# development concepts, and have access to standard development tools.</p>
<p>We do not aim to teach you the general development principles but to introduce how website development works in Xperience.</p>

<div>

<div>
<p>Use these free resources to quickly get on board with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?tabs=visual-studio" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core MVC development</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-12" target="_blank">C# syntax nuances</a>.</p>
<p>While we won’t fully leverage the MVC architectural pattern, you’ll find it beneficial to know the concepts behind the approach to understand how certain Xperience features work.</p>

<h2 id="development-model-of-xperience-by-kentico">Development model of Xperience by Kentico</h2>
<p>Xperience projects are <a href="http://asp.net/" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a> Core applications with two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Live site</strong> displays content managed by Xperience to your visitors. It retrieves the content using the Xperience API, integrated into the application via <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/website-development-basics/configure-new-projects/xperience-by-kentico-nuget-packages">Xperience NuGet packages</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Xperience administration</strong> provides a user interface to edit and manage content, and to configure various system features.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram summarizes the general roles of the main personas that interact with an Xperience site – Xperience users, developers, and website visitors:</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="xperience-administration">Xperience administration</h2>
<p>The administration interface allows editors to <strong>manage their project’s content</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub"><strong>Content hub</strong></a> application is where users manage reusable content items (structured content), which they can reference in various channels.</p>
<p>A <strong>website channel</strong> represents a site in the administration UI. Each website channel has its own application. Editors create pages and organize them in a content tree. They can add and modify content, use the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder"><strong>Page Builder</strong></a> and workflow features, and preview changes before publishing their content live.</p>
<p>Your role as a developer is to <strong>design the content structure</strong> for editors to work with based on customer business requirements. You can also create custom Page Builder components and UI controls or add new administration interface functionality.</p>
