<title>Missing documentation pages</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Xperience by Kentico introduces major changes from previous versions of Kentico Xperience, and currently provides a smaller, more focused, set of features. As a result, the documentation was significantly rewritten and reorganized. Many documentation pages that were present in older versions do not have equivalent pages in the Xperience by Kentico documentation. However, the same or similar scenario may still be documented on another page.</p>
