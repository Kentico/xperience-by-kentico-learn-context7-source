<p>Content hub provides a way for users to create, store, manage, and publish content across multiple channels. Each piece of content is stored in the hub as a reusable <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">content item</a>.</p>
<p>Content items can be organized into <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders">folders</a>. <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">Content item assets</a> allow users to store various types of files that can be reused throughout the system. To learn more about how to structure the content in your project, see <a href="/guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide">Content modeling</a> guide.</p>
<p>The Content hub application is scoped under <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces">workspaces</a>, allowing content stored inside it to be separated into distinct workspaces.</p>
<p>The Content hub UI allows you to view all content items in the system:</p>
