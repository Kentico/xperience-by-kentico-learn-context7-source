<p>The <strong>Forms</strong> application enables content editors to create and edit forms. Forms allow you to gather structured data from website visitors. A typical example can be a “Contact Us” form or a form in which visitors provide some data required to attain a specific goal.</p>
<p>The system uses information provided via forms to update the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contacts</a> representing your website’s visitors (provided they give the necessary <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management">consent</a>). For example, forms can be a way for visitors to provide their location or other information that your site’s developers can use to <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/widget-personalization">personalize displayed content</a>.</p>
