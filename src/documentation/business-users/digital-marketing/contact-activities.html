<title>Contact activities</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Activities represent actions that your <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contacts</a> perform. For example, the system logs activities when visitors view <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">pages</a> or submit <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">forms</a> on the site.</p>
<p>The gathered activity data allows you to evaluate the behavior of your contacts and their interactions across your content channels.</p>
<h2 id="view-contact-activities">View contact activities</h2>
<p>Once you or your project’s administrators have <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities">set up tracking of activities</a>, you can monitor the activities of all <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contacts</a> in the <strong>Contact management</strong> application on the <strong>Activities</strong> tab.</p>
<p>The activity log shows you which actions your visitors performed, such as page visits or form submissions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To view the activities of a specific contact:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the <strong>Contact management</strong> application and view the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the contact in the list.</li>
<li>Switch to the <strong>Activities</strong> sub-tab for the contact.</li>
</ol>
