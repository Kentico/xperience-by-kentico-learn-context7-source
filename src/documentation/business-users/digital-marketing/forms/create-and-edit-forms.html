<title>Create and edit forms</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You can create new forms in the <strong>Forms</strong> application:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the <strong>Forms</strong> application.</li>
<li>Select <strong>New form</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The system creates a new form and opens the <strong>Form Builder</strong>.</p>
<p>Form Builder is a graphical interface for designing forms in Xperience. Editors modify the overall form layout, add various types of fields, and adjust their position in the form. The resulting form appears as it will display on the live site.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using Form Builder, editors can:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#set-form-layout">Set form layout</a></li>
<li><a href="#add-fields">Add fields</a></li>
<li><a href="#move-and-reorder-fields">Move and reorder fields</a></li>
<li><a href="#delete-fields">Delete fields</a></li>
<li><a href="#set-the-submit-button-text">Set the submit button text</a></li>
<li><a href="#form-submission-notifications">Form submission notifications</a></li>
<li><a href="#automation-and-autoresponders">Automation and autoresponders</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the <em>Form Builder</em> interface, the options panel on the right can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/manage-form-submissions">Access form submissions collected from users</a></li>
<li><a href="#configure-form-properties-and-behavior">Configure general form properties and behavior</a></li>
<li><a href="#actions-after-form-submission">Choose actions that occur after the form is submitted</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="set-form-layout">Set form layout</h2>
<p>The layout of a form is composed of sections. Each section contains one or more zones to which you can <a href="#add-fields">add fields</a>.</p>
<p>The system provides a <strong>Default</strong> section that organizes fields in a basic single-column layout. The project’s developers may prepare additional types of sections that allow you to create more advanced form layouts.</p>
<p>To edit the layout of a form, add or adjust sections using gray UI elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Add section</strong> – select a gray <em>plus</em> button located on the left to insert a new section. The list of available section types depends on the implementation of your project.</li>
<li>
<strong>Move section</strong> – hover over a section and drag it by the handle among the section buttons on the right.</li>
<li>
<strong>Change section type</strong> – you can change the type of a section to adjust the form’s layout. Hover over the section you want to modify, select the <em>Change section type</em> button, and select the section type you wish to use.</li>
<li>
<strong>Configure section</strong> – opens a dialog where you can set values for properties that affect the content, appearance, or behavior of the section. The <em>Configure</em> button is only available for sections with configurable properties. Check with your project’s administrators or developers for more information about the available section types and their properties.</li>
<li>
<strong>Delete section</strong> – hover over the section you want to remove and select the delete button on the right. This also deletes all form fields in the section, which can lead to a loss of data in existing forms.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Changes made to sections are saved automatically. After creating the required form layout through sections, you can <a href="#move-and-reorder-fields">move fields</a> between the resulting zones.</p>
<h2 id="add-fields">Add fields</h2>
<p>Select the purple <em>plus</em> buttons in the form editing area to add new fields. The <strong>Fields</strong> dialog opens, which allows you to add fields from two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Featured</strong> – offers fields frequently included in forms, preconfigured for easy and quick use. Many featured fields automatically map the submitted information to the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contact</a> representing the visitor in the system (for visitors who give <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management">consent</a>). See the <a href="#Createandeditforms-ContactMapping">contact attribute mapping</a> section for more details.</li>
<li>
<strong>New field</strong> – allows editors to select a basic field type and configure the field from scratch. Information collected by these fields is not automatically used by the system (unless <a href="#Createandeditforms-ContactMapping">configured otherwise</a>), but can be <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/manage-form-submissions">accessed in the form’s submissions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The form saves automatically each time a new field is added. </p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>After creating a new field, we recommend setting an appropriate <strong>Name</strong> property based on the field’s purpose. By default, the <em>Name</em> is generated based on the type of the selected field type. Changing the value later once the form starts collecting data can be problematic.</p>
<p>See <a href="#field-properties">Field properties</a> for details.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="hide-featured-fields">Hide featured fields</h3>
<p>If any of the featured fields are not relevant for your forms, you can hide them from the <em>Fields</em> dialog that appears when adding new form fields:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Switch to the <strong>Featured fields</strong> tab in the left-side navigation menu of the <strong>Forms</strong> application.</li>
<li>Toggle the <strong>Visibility in forms</strong> switcher for the corresponding featured fields.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="field-properties">Field properties</h3>
<p>Fields in the form are configurable. You can change a field’s label, tooltip, default value, and other properties depending on the field type via the <strong>properties dialog</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select the field you wish to configure.</li>
<li>Open the properties dialog by selecting configure ().<br>
<strong></strong>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Apply</strong> to save your changes.</li>
</ol>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>You can configure fields to behave as “smart fields,” which means they are only displayed on repeated views of a form as a replacement for other fields that the visitor has already filled in. For more information, see <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/use-smart-fields-in-forms">Use smart fields in forms</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="map-form-submission-to-contact-attributes"> Map form submission to contact attributes</h3>
<p>Xperience can use the information collected via forms to update <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contacts</a> representing website visitors in the system. If a visitor submits a form, the system automatically transfers the entered values into the data of a matching contact (for visitors who give <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management">consent</a>). You can also use the same approach to update the data of existing contacts when a visitor provides new information.</p>
<p>Mapping links a form field to a specific contact attribute. You control how form fields are mapped via the <strong>Mapped to contact attribute</strong> <a href="#field-properties">field property</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, if the form has a field where users enter their email address, you can choose this field for the <strong>Email</strong> contact attribute. When a user submits the form, the system automatically saves the field’s value as the email address of the contact representing the given user.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Contact mapping and featured fields</strong></p>
<p>Certain <em>featured</em> fields are preconfigured to map to the corresponding contact attribute (e.g., First name, Last name, Email). The mapping can be changed. You can view a modify the field’s configuration using the <a href="#field-properties">properties dialog</a>.</p>
</div>


<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Contact email changes</strong></p>
<p>If you have the <em>Overwrite existing contact information with submitted data</em> option enabled on the form’s <a href="#configure-form-properties-and-behavior">General tab</a>, it is possible for visitors to change their contact information by submitting data into mapped fields. However, because a contact’s email address is its main identifier in Xperience, the system <strong>does not allow the email to be changed</strong> based on data submitted through forms.</p>
<p>If you have a form field mapped to the <em>Email</em> contact attribute, and a visitor submits a different value than the associated contact’s current email address, all related field updates are performed for a different contact. Either an existing contact that matches the submitted email value is used, or a new contact is created.</p>
<p>In these cases, the given visitor’s associated contact remains unchanged, but all subsequent actions, such as logging of the <em>Form submission</em> <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-activities">activity</a> and triggering of <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a>, are done for the “other” contact that matches the submitted email address.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="contact-segmentation">Contact segmentation</h3>
<p>You can use forms to segment your contacts. For example, you can build a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact group</a> for visitors who have submitted the <em>Contact Us</em> form.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="move-and-reorder-fields">Move and reorder fields</h2>
<p>To change the order of existing fields or move them between different zones in the form layout:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select a field in the form.</li>
<li>Drag the field by the <em>handle</em> () or the header that appears when you select a field.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="delete-fields">Delete fields</h2>
<p>To delete fields from the form:</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Removing fields from forms with existing submissions</strong></p>
<p>Removing a field from forms with existing submissions also deletes all data the field gathered over its lifetime.</p>
</div>

<ol type="1">
<li>Select the field you wish to remove.</li>
<li>Select the delete (<i></i>) icon in the upper right.</li>
<li>Confirm the removal via the popup dialog.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="set-the-submit-button-text">Set the submit button text</h2>
<p>Every form contains a button that allows users to submit the entered data. The submit button is positioned at the bottom of the form and cannot be moved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Form Builder allows editors to change the text of the submit button’s label:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hover over the submit button at the bottom of the form.</li>
<li>Open the button’s properties dialog by selecting configure ().</li>
<li>Enter the desired text into the <strong>Submit button text</strong> property.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Apply</strong> to save the change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="configure-form-properties-and-behavior">Configure form properties and behavior</h2>
<p>After you create a form or when editing an existing form, you can define the following properties by selecting <strong>General</strong> in the options panel on the right:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td colspan="1">
<p>Property</p>
</td>
<td colspan="1">

<p>Select <strong>Save</strong> to confirm any changes.</p>
<h2 id="actions-after-form-submission">Actions after form submission</h2>
<p>There are several possible actions that can occur after a user submits a form on the live site – <em>Display text</em>, <em>Redirect to page</em>, <em>Redirect to URL</em>. The action is configured when <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/display-forms-on-pages">placing individual forms</a> onto a website channel page.</p>
<h2 id="form-submission-notifications">Form submission notifications</h2>
<p>The system can be configured to send notifications to selected administration users whenever a visitor on the live site submits a particular form. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/notifications#form-submission-notifications">Form submission notifications</a>.</p>
<h2 id="automation-and-autoresponders">Automation and autoresponders</h2>
<p>You can enable a basic form autoresponder or set up advanced email automation. This allows you to automatically send one or more email messages to every user who submits the form.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Email field requirement</strong></p>
<p>To send autoresponder emails or automated email follow-ups, the form must contain a field that allows users to submit their email address. The autoresponder can only be enabled if a form field is <a href="#Createandeditforms-ContactMapping">mapped</a> to the <strong>Email</strong> contact attribute in the <strong>Form Builder</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="autoresponders">Autoresponders</h3>
<p>When editing a form in the <strong>Forms</strong> application, select <strong>Autoresponder</strong> in the options panel on the right. To send a simple autoresponder email, select one of the following <strong>Autoresponder</strong> options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Select email</strong> – sends an email prepared in an email channel application in the Xperience administration. This option is recommended for most scenarios. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">Emails</a> for more information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Custom</strong> – for scenarios that require advanced or dynamic autoresponder content. Sends a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/custom-form-autoresponder-emails">custom autoresponder</a> email prepared by developers, with any required content, including values that the user entered into the form. Note that the system does not <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/track-email-statistics">track statistics</a> for custom form autoresponder emails.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Select <strong>Save</strong> to confirm any changes.</p>
<h3 id="automation-processes">Automation processes</h3>
<p>If you wish to set up a more advanced email scenario when a form is submitted, you can create an <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation process</a> in the <strong>Forms</strong> application via the <strong>Automation</strong> tab in the options panel on the right. This allows you to send a series of multiple emails, add waiting intervals, or send different emails based on conditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once completed and enabled, the automation process is then triggered for any user who submits the form.</p>
