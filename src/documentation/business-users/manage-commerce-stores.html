<p>The digital commerce feature provides you with simple online stores where you can sell physical or digital products. It offers the essential tools, data structure, and actions needed to manage your shop and process orders.</p>
<h2 id="manage-products">Manage products</h2>
<p>Due to the customizability of the Xperience by Kentico commerce feature, how you manage products depends on the implementation of your <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/model-product-catalog">product catalog</a>.</p>
<p>The following image shows a <strong>sample</strong> listing of products hosted in the content hub from the Dancing Goat sample site:</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="manage-customers">Manage customers</h2>
<p>The <strong>Customers</strong> application allows you to view customer details, and track orders made by customers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Customers</strong> application.</li>
<li>Select a customer to view their details.
<ul>
<li>On the <strong>Addresses</strong> tab, you can view and manage customer addresses.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Orders</strong> tab, you can view a list of orders made by the customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="manage-orders">Manage orders</h2>
<p>The <strong>Orders</strong> application allows users to list orders, view order details, change order statuses, and finalize orders.</p>
<h3 id="view-details-of-orders">View details of orders</h3>
<p>To view details of an order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Orders</strong> application.</li>
<li>Find and select the order you want to modify.
<ul>
<li>You can use the search interface or sort orders by status.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Overview</strong> tab, you can view basic order info and customer details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Ordered items</strong> tab to view a list of products in the order.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3 id="view-orders-from-specific-customers">View orders from specific customers</h3>
<p>You can view all orders that were made by one customer:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Customers</strong> application.</li>
<li>Select a customer whose orders you want to view.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Orders</strong> tab to view a list of orders created by the selected customer.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3 id="change-order-status">Change order status</h3>
<p>To change the status of an order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Orders</strong> application.</li>
<li>Find and select the order you want to modify.
<ul>
<li>You can use the search interface or sort orders by status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Update order status</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the new status to which you want to move the order and <strong>Confirm</strong> the changes.
<ul>
<li>Depending on your <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/configure-order-statuses#configure-notifications-for-order-statuses">commerce configuration</a>, selected users may receive a notification that a new order was moved to the new status. Note that if you skip statuses (e.g., move an order from the initial to the final status while skipping all other statuses), the notification is only sent for the status to which you move the order, not for the intermediate statuses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>You can now see the order in the listing with the new status.</p>
