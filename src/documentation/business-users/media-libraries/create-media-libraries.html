<p><strong>Media libraries sunset</strong></p>
<p>Media libraries have been officially sunset, and their related API members have been marked as obsolete. Support for media libraries will continue for one more year (until July 24, 2026), after which the feature and all associated APIs will be completely removed.</p>
