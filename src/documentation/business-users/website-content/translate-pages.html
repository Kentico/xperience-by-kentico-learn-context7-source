<title>Translate pages</title>

<body>
<p>Before you can translate individual pages in your project into other languages, you need to set those up in the <strong>Languages</strong> application. For detailed info on how to configure multiple languages in Xperience, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">Languages</a>.</p>
<p>Afterwards, you can start to translate and create language variants of your pages: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the website channel where you want to translate pages.</p></li>
<li>
<p>In the header bar, open the language switcher.<br>
</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>The language switcher is available only if two or more languages are set up.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Select the language to translate pages into.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Select the page to translate.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Untranslated pages are visually marked by the <em>Not translated</em> (<span></span>) workflow status.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the translated page name. You can now choose one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Copy content from another language</strong> is the preselected option. By default, the closest language in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">fallback chain</a> is preselected. You can choose a different language from the drop-down list. This option lets you prefill the content fields with the content available in the chosen language. If a linked item does not have a translated or published version, a warning will be displayed, and a fallback language variant of the item will be used.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create empty page</strong> allows you to create an empty page with blank fields. Linked items need to be re-linked into the new language variant of the translated page.</li>
<li>
<strong>Translate using AIRA</strong> allows you to translate the name and content of your page using <a href="/documentation/business-users/aira">AIRA</a> instead of manually translating content yourself, this also includes <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> content. When using this option, subsequent steps are skipped and a new language variant is created directly in the <em>Draft</em> stage. The behavior of the translation can be <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/aira-configuration#configure-aira-translations">configured</a>, allowing you to specify, for example, formatting rules or brand terminology.

<div>

</div>
<div>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/aira#aira-translations">AIRA translations</a> currently do not support automatic translation of linked content items, pages, and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies">taxonomies</a>. After translating your page using AIRA, review your content, including links, to ensure they lead to the correct language variant.
</div>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Continue</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the translated values of the page’s fields.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Save</strong> the translated page.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You have now successfully translated the page. Note that the particular language variant is now only a <em>Draft</em> and won’t be accessible on the live site until you <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages">publish</a> it. Until you do so, the language variant in the fallback language will be displayed.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Translated content items on untranslated pages are loaded in the fallback language. However, there is an exception in case the content items are injected into the page via code. In that case, content items are loaded in the language variant according to the requested language. For more information on language fallbacks, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">Languages</a>.</p>
