<title>Track page usages</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Tracking of page usages allows editors to see where their pages are used and in what channels. It is especially useful to see what impact <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages">editing</a> or <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/delete-pages">deleting</a> a page would have. For example, you can check whether the page you are about to delete is used in published content and whether deleting the page may break that content.</p>
<p>The chain of usage starts with items that directly reference your page. These items, in turn, may be used in other items (found under <em>Related items</em>), and this pattern continues. Unfolding these chains of usage creates a tree-like structure, illustrating how your content item is referenced across different levels.</p>
<p>Usage tracking allows you to monitor items linked in the the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combined content selector – Tracks usage through the <em>Combined content selector</em> form component.</li>
<li>Page selector – Monitors pages linked through the <em>Page selector</em> form component.</li>
<li>Rich text editor – Includes widgets, content fields, in-line editors, and other rich text elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>To view the usages of a page:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open a website channel application.</li>
<li>Select the page you want to track from the content tree.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Used in</strong> tab to view where the selected page is used.</li>
</ol>
