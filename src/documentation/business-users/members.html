<p>Visitors who register an account in the system are referred to as <em>members</em>. Unlike <em>Users</em> who can access the admin UI, members can access only the front-facing part of an application, such as a website. They can browse pages or access member-only sections of the website.</p>
<p>Member accounts are managed using the <strong>Members</strong> application. The application’s home page lists all member accounts in the system.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The <strong>Members</strong> application only displays visitor accounts registered in the system. If the application is empty, either your project has no registered accounts, or it doesn’t support <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/registration-and-authentication">Registration and authentication</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="view-member-details">View member details</h2>
<p>Select a member from the listing to view their account details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Member name</strong> – the name used by the member to sign in. Modifying this value may <strong>change</strong> the sign-in credentials for the member, depending on your site’s implementation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Email</strong> – the email used by the member to sign in. Modifying this value may <strong>change</strong> the sign-in credentials for the member, depending on your site’s implementation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Enabled</strong> – determines whether the member account is allowed to sign in.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3 id="external-user-accounts">External user accounts</h3>
<p>Users that create an account using an external provider (e.g., Google or Facebook) cannot be edited via the <em>Members</em> application. </p>
<h2 id="disable-or-delete-members">Disable or delete members</h2>
<p><strong>Disabling</strong> a member account prevents visitors from signing in with the associated credentials. However, the account stays in the system and can be reactivated later.</p>
<p>To disable an account:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the member listing, select the additional actions menu (…).</li>
<li>Select <strong>Disable</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The member account is now disabled and cannot be used to sign in.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting</strong> a member account removes it from the system completely. It cannot be used to sign in again unless the visitor registers a new account.</p>
<p>To delete an account:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the member listing, select the <strong>Delete</strong> action.</li>
<li>Confirm the deletion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The member account is now deleted.</p>
