<p>This glossary provides an overview of Xperience by Kentico terminology you may encounter when using the product or reading the documentation. The intended audience is all roles interacting with the system, from technical (developers, administrators) to business users (content editors, marketers).</p>
<p>You don’t need to learn all these terms by heart, but you can use the tables below as a reference if you encounter a new phrase while working with the system. If you think an important term is missing from this reference, leave us feedback via the <em>Send us feedback</em> button at the bottom of the page.</p>
