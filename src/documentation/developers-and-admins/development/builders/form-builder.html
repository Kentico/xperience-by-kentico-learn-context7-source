<p>The Xperience Form Builder offers an intuitive graphical editor that allows content creators and marketers to <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">compose online forms</a>. It is available on the <strong>Form Builder</strong> tab of the <strong>Forms</strong> application when editing a form.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="displaying-forms">Displaying forms</h2>
<p>Forms created in the Form Builder can be displayed on the website in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content editors can <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/display-forms-on-pages">place</a> the forms onto the live site as widgets using the <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/widgets-and-page-builder">Page Builder</a>.</li>
<li>Developers can add forms directly into the views of pages by <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/render-widgets-in-code">rendering</a> the <em>Form</em> widget.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="form-builder-components">Form Builder components</h2>
<p>The Form Builder framework consists of a number of component types, each contributing specific functionality.</p>
<section id="form-sections">
<h4>Form sections</h4>
<p><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-sections">Form sections</a> drive the overall layout of forms. They represent reusable pieces of markup that can store any number of form zones – areas where content creators place form fields. Sections are fully customizable, and as a developer, you have absolute freedom in the way you set each section’s layout. Form sections can be implemented with <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-sections/form-section-properties">properties</a>, which allow content editors to adjust the content or behavior of the sections using configuration dialogs in the Form Builder interface.</p>
<p>See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-sections">Form sections</a> to learn how to implement and customize form sections.</p>
</section>
<section id="form-components">
<h4>Form components</h4>
<p>The main building blocks of forms are <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-components">form components</a> – instances of components represent individual form fields. The implementation of form components consists of two classes, one facilitating the front-end functionality, the other encapsulating the state as configured via the Form Builder’s properties panel, and a corresponding partial view, providing the component’s visual elements.</p>
<p>Natively, Xperience contains a set of form components available for use instantly, without the need of any custom development on your part. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/reference-form-builder-components">Reference - Form Builder components</a> for a comprehensive list. You can also implement form components suited for your specific scenarios. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-components">Form components</a> for more information and a general overview.</p>
</section>
<p>Components need to be registered under a unique <em>Identifier,</em> with a <em>Name</em> that is displayed in the Form Builder interface.</p>
<h2 id="form-builder-utilities">Form Builder utilities</h2>
<p>The system provides a set of extension methods and ASP.NET Core <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/reference-tag-helpers">Tag Helpers</a> designed to facilitate development of new Form Builder components. To easily access these extension methods in the code of your views, edit your project’s <strong>Views\ViewImports.cshtml</strong> file and:</p>
<ul>
<li>add the <code>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc</code> namespace</li>
<li>add the Tag Helpers from the <code>Kentico.Content.Web.Mvc</code> namespace</li>
</ul>
