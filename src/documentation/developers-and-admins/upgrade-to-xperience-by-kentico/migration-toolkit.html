<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kentico-migration-tool" target="_blank">Kentico Migration Tool</a> is versioned to correspond to Xperience by Kentico product versions. See the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kentico-migration-tool?tab=readme-ov-file#library-version-matrix" target="_blank">version matrix</a> in the tool’s <em>README</em> file to select the correct version for your project.</p>

<p>Due to differences in the feature set of the products, the Kentico Migration Tool cannot transfer all data available in the older Kentico versions. Certain types of data are migrated to a suitable alternative or discarded.</p>
<p>The Kentico Migration Tool migrates content and objects stored in the database along with related binary data on the file system, such as <a href="/documentation/business-users/media-libraries">media library</a> files.</p>
<p>The following diagram showcases all available upgrade paths to get from older Kentico versions to Xperience by Kentico using <a href="https://devnet.kentico.com/download/upgrades" target="_blank">Kentico upgrade tools</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KenticoDevTrev/KX12To13Converter" target="_blank">community conversion tools</a> and the Kentico Migration Tool.

<h2 id="customize-the-migration-tools">Customize the migration tools</h2>
<p>The migration tools are designed to cover the most common migration cases and help streamline the process of transferring a project to Xperience by Kentico. Since implementation details and content models vary from project to project, the migration tools may not always fully align with your requirements. The tools are open-source for this reason – you can customize them or even create your own tools based on the <a href="#universal-migration-tool">Universal Migration Tool</a>.</p>
<p>If you are <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/upgrade-to-xperience-by-kentico">upgrading from Kentico Xperience</a>, you can extend the <a href="#kentico-migration-tool">Kentico Migration Tool</a> with the use of the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kentico-migration-tool/tree/master/Migration.Tool.Extensions" target="_blank">Migration.Tool.Extensions</a> module. The module enables you to remap and optimize the original content model to the new <a href="/guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide">content model</a> recommended for Xperience by Kentico, remodel widgets, migrate page types to reusable field schemas and more.</p>
