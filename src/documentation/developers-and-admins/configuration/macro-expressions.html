<body>
<p>Macros are text expressions that the system evaluates and resolves into values. For more information about macro usage, seeÂ <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/macro-expressions/macro-syntax">Macro syntax</a>.</p>
<h2 id="macro-availability">Macro availability</h2>
<p>In the current version of Xperience by Kentico, macro expressions are usable in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the source code of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-templates">Email templates</a>
</li>
<li>the <strong>Modules</strong> application when defining default values for the editing forms of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">object types</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="development-considerations">Development considerations</h2>
<p>Developers and administrators need to consider macros when deploying content and other data between different instances of Xperience, for example using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a>. To ensure that all functionality relying on macros works correctly in these scenarios, macros must have valid signatures for their current environment. See the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/macro-expressions/macro-signatures">Macro signatures</a> page to learn more.</p>
