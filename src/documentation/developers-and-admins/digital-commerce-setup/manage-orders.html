<p><strong>Developer preview feature</strong></p>
<p>The digital commerce feature is currently not fully functional, and primarily intended to allow technical users to familiarize themselves with the development process of the commerce feature. You can expect the feature to be updated and extended in upcoming releases.</p>
<p>The related API is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#experimental-attributes" target="_blank">marked as experimental</a> and usage will result in warnings when compiling your project. The warnings are treated as errors for reporting purposes. To use the code, you need to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/experimental-overview#suppress-warnings" target="_blank">suppress</a> the warnings.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>DO</strong> try out development of digital commerce and examine the sample in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation#available-project-templates">Dancing Goat project template</a>.</li>

Note that if you skip statuses (e.g., move an order from the initial to the final status while skipping all other statuses), the notification is only sent for the status to which you move the order, not for the intermediate statuses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
