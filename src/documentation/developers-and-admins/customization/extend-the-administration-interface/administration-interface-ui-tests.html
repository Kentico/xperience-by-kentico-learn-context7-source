<title>Administration interface UI tests</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>UI tests, or user interface tests, are a type of software testing that checks whether the user interface of an application or system behaves as expected.</p>
<p>UI tests can be performed manually or automated. Manual testing involves a human tester going through individual scenarios in the applicationâ€™s user interface, and interacting with the controls and elements to verify their behavior. Automated testing, on the other hand, involves using software tools to automate the testing process.</p>
<p>This page focuses on the automated aspect of UI testing in Xperience, specifically in the administration interface. Writing UI tests is a good practice when introducing customizations or changes to the administration UI. Failing tests can help discover incorrect behavior early in development and mitigate regression in existing functionality.</p>
<h2 id="ui-test-support-in-the-admin-ui">UI test support in the admin UI</h2>
<p>To facilitate the creation of UI tests, HTML elements in the admin UI have a <code>data-testid</code> attribute that contains a static identifier of the component. This identifier is identical for each instance of the same component on a page. For example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can see, all of the application tile components have identical <code>data-testid</code> attribute values. This allows UI tests to select desired elements that could otherwise only be identified via a random string generated by React.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>While the use of the <code>data-testid</code> attribute is supported in the admin UI for testing purposes, we do not guarantee its stability across releases. These attributes may change without notice based on internal development needs.</p>
</div>

<p>The <code>data-testid</code> attribute is generated via a <code>dataTestId</code> prop on Xperience components. Using the <code>Input</code> component from <code>\@kentico/xperience\-admin\-components</code> as an example:</p>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<span>JS</span>
</div>
<strong>Populating data-testid</strong>
</div>
<div>
<button>
<span></span><span></span> <span>Copy</span>
</button>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<pre><code>

import { Input } from '@kentico/xperience-admin-components';

...

&lt;Input markAsRequired={props.required}
                    invalid={props.invalid}
                    label={props.label}
                    value={name}
                    onChange={onNameChange}
                    disabled={props.disabled}
                    dataTestId="cool-input" /&gt;

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>Input</code> component when used as shown above, renders with <code>data-testid="cool-input"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="supported-testing-flows">Supported testing flows</h3>
<p>The admin UI currently supports only end-to-end (E2E) testing. Other testing strategies, such as <em>Component testing</em>, are not officially supported or documented at this time.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-testing-frameworks">Recommended testing frameworks</h2>
<p>We recommend using <a href="#cypress">Cypress</a> or <a href="#playwright">Playwright</a> to UI test the Xperience administration interface.</p>
<h3 id="cypress">Cypress</h3>
<p>Cypress is a modern, open-source, JavaScript-based testing framework designed for E2E testing of web applications. See the <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/" target="_blank">Cypress documentation</a> for a general introduction and overview of the framework.</p>
<p>You can find detailed instructions for <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress" target="_blank">installing Cypress</a> and <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test" target="_blank">writing your first E2E test</a> in their official guides.</p>
<h3 id="playwright">Playwright</h3>
<p>Playwright is a modern, open-source framework developed by Microsoft for E2E testing of web applications across multiple browsers. See the <a href="https://playwright.dev/" target="_blank">Playwright documentation</a> for a general introduction and overview of the framework.</p>
