<li>
<a href="#event-log-and-exceptions">Monitor the event log and exceptions of application deployments</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#performance-metrics">Evaluate the performance metrics of your applications.</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2 id="access-deployed-applications">Access deployed applications</h2>
<p>After successfully <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#DeploytotheSaaSenvironment-deploy">uploading the deployment package</a> to the QA environment or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-application-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deploying the package to another deployment environment</a>, use the application URL displayed in the <strong>Deployments</strong> application under <strong>Latest deployments</strong> to access the deployed application.</p>
<p>Each project has a default system domain in format: <em><strong>&lt;environment&gt;-</strong>&lt;project_code_name&gt;.<strong>xperience-sites.com</strong></em></p>
<p>The default domain can be used to access the project’s administration UI by appending the <em>/admin</em> path to the URL. You can view your project’s default system domains or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration#custom-system-email-domains-in-the-saas-environment">customize</a> your system Email sending and Email service domain in the <strong>Channels and Domains → System domains</strong> application in Xperience Portal.</p>
<p>Additionally, projects also have domains for individual website and email channels. You can set up custom domains for website and email channels in the PROD or STG environment. To learn more, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#manage-channel-domains-in-xperience-portal">Website channels in the SaaS environment</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management#manage-email-channel-domains-in-xperience-portal">Email channels in the SaaS environment</a>.</p>
<h2 id="restart-deployed-applications">Restart deployed applications</h2>
<p>If you encounter any issue that requires you to restart the Xperience by Kentico application, you can <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/system-overview#restart-the-application">restart the application</a> in the administration interface. However, when you cannot access the administration interface, you can restart the application from Xperience Portal.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#XperiencePortal-AccessPortal">Access your Xperience Portal project</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Deployments</strong> application.</li>
<li>
<strong>Restart</strong> the desired environment.
<ul>
<li>For non-production environments (<strong>QA</strong>, <strong>UAT</strong>), the <em>Restart</em> button is available to all portal users. However, only users in <strong>Tenant Administrator</strong> or <strong>DevOps Engineer</strong> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal/reference-xperience-portal-user-roles">roles</a> can restart production environments (<strong>PROD</strong>, <strong>STG</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wait until the restart is finished.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h2 id="channel-management">Channel management</h2>
<p>Content in Xperience by Kentico is encapsulated within channels, which are bound to specific domains. To allow the content to be presented by deployments in the SaaS environment, you need to add and configure all website and email channels within Xperience Portal in the <strong>Channels and Domains</strong> application.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#website-channels-in-the-saas-environment">Website channels in the SaaS environment</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="restore-points">Restore points</h2>
<p>The SaaS environment uses a two-tier system consisting of <strong>restore points</strong> and <strong>exports</strong> to ensure data protection and disaster recovery. This system allows you to restore previous versions of your project for a particular environment.</p>
<p>Xperience Portal creates <a href="#automatic-restore-points-and-exports">automatic restore points and exports</a>, and you can also <a href="#create-a-manual-restore-point">create manual restore points</a> for production and non-production environments. Restore points can be viewed, managed and <a href="#restore-from-a-restore-point">restored</a> under <strong>Data Management</strong> → <strong>Restore points</strong>.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>SaaS application components</strong></p>
<p>Applications deployed in the SaaS environment consist of the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application service – application binaries and runtime files</li>
<li>Database – reflects the current state of the environment’s database</li>
<li>Storage and files – reflects the current state of files in the environment’s Azure Blob storage</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="restore-points-vs.-exports">Restore points vs. exports</h3>
<p>Understanding the difference between restore points and exports is crucial for effective data management:</p>
<p><strong>Restore points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A timestamp referencing the app state at a given time</li>
<li>Restore points enable you to restore the application to a previous state</li>
<li>Created automatically before deployments, manually on demand, or on a regular schedule</li>
<li>Always contain all services (application, database, and storage)</li>
<li>Faster creation process as files aren’t physically copied</li>
<li>Storage files can be downloaded directly; application service files cannot be downloaded or exported; database needs to be exported to access the data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Physical copies of data that can be downloaded</li>
<li>Can be full (all services) or partial (selected services)
<ul>
<li>Full exports enable you to restore a project to a previous state in the SaaS environment, providing the same functionality as restore points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can be downloaded and stored locally for long-term storage</li>
<li>Limited to 30 database exports per environment per month and 30 application service exports per environment per month (may be adjusted with custom plans)</li>
<li>The files are retained for 60 hours after the export is created and you need to download them before they are removed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="automatic-restore-points-and-exports">Automatic restore points and exports</h3>
<p>Kentico automatically creates the following <strong>restore points and exports</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For all environments:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Predeployment restore points</em> which expire in 30 days</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the <em>Staging</em> or <em>Production</em> environment:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Daily restore points</em> with a retention policy based on your service plan:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Level 1</em> – 3 days</li>
<li>
<em>Level 2</em> – 3 days</li>
<li>
<em>Custom</em> – 7 days or more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>Weekly full exports</em> with a retention policy of 30 days (created on Sundays)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/saas-service-plans">SaaS service plans</a> for information about service plans and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/licenses#licensing-xperience-by-kentico">Licensing Xperience by Kentico</a> for information how to change to a different service plan.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="create-a-manual-restore-point">Create a manual restore point</h3>
<p>You can create manual restore points for both production and non-production environments. These restore points can then be exported when you need to download or inspect the data.</p>
<p>The retention policy for manual restore points is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Restore points</em>:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Level 1</em> service plan – 3 days</li>
<li>
<em>Level 2</em> service plan – 3 days</li>
<li>
<em>Custom</em> service plan – 7 days or more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a manual restore point:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to <strong>Data Management</strong> → <strong>Restore points</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Create restore point</strong> in the upper-right corner.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Select the environment for which you want to create a restore point.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Only <strong>Tenant administrator</strong> and <strong>DevOps</strong> roles can access and create restore points for <strong>Production</strong> or <strong>Staging</strong> environments. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal/reference-xperience-portal-user-roles">Reference - Xperience Portal user roles</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Create</strong> and wait for the restore point to be created.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>SaaS processes (e.g., restore points, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-application-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deployments</a>) are queued, and you can have only one process running at a time.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your restore point is now available in the <strong>Restore points</strong> application under <strong>Data Management</strong>. To access the files or download the data, you need to create an export from this restore point.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-manual-export">Create a manual export</h3>
<p>The export process creates physical copies of the data, which can then be downloaded. Exports are limited to 30 database exports per environment per month and 30 application service exports per environment per month (may be adjusted with custom plans).</p>
<p>To create a manual export:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to <strong>Data Management</strong> → <strong>Restore points</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Create restore point</strong> in the upper-right corner.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Select the environment for which you want to create an export.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Only <strong>Tenant administrator</strong> and <strong>DevOps</strong> roles can access and create restore points for <strong>Production</strong> or <strong>Staging</strong> environments. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal/reference-xperience-portal-user-roles">Reference - Xperience Portal user roles</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Export</strong> in the <strong>Restore point type</strong> selector.</p></li>
<li><p>Select what services should be included in the export. Note that only a full export (with all services included) can be used to restore a project to a previous state.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Create</strong> and wait for the export to be created.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>SaaS processes (e.g., restore points, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-application-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deployments</a>) are queued, and you can have only one process running at a time.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Downloading exports allows you to inspect the state of the application, debug the database or check the integrity, versions, and number of files in the deployment environment.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="export-and-download-from-restore-points">Export and download from restore points</h3>
<p>You can also download some data from restore points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage files can be downloaded directly.</li>
<li>Database needs to be exported to access the data. Database exports are limited to 30 exports per environment per month (may be adjusted with custom plans).</li>
<li>Application service files cannot be downloaded or exported from restore points. However, you can create manual exports of application services using the <a href="#create-a-manual-export">manual export process</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to <strong>Data Management</strong> → <strong>Restore points</strong>.</li>
<li>Select an environment and select <strong>Apply</strong>. A list of restore points for the environment is displayed.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create export</strong> next to the database of a restore point you want to download.</li>
<li>Once the export is ready, download it by selecting <strong>Download</strong> () under <strong>Actions</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<div>

</div>

<h3 id="restore-from-a-restore-point">Restore from a restore point</h3>
<p>You can restore your application to a previous state using restore points. This is useful if you need to revert changes or recover from an issue.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to <strong>Data Management</strong> → <strong>Restore points</strong>.</li>
<li>Select an environment and select <strong>Apply</strong>. A list of restore points for the environment is displayed.</li>
<li>Restore from a restore point by selecting <strong>Restore</strong> (<i></i>) next to a restore point.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Restore a restore point or an export</strong> page:
<ul>
<li>Select the exact restore point you wish to restore from.</li>
<li>Select whether to restore immediately or schedule the restore for a later date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Restore</strong> and wait for the restore process to complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="custom-restore">Custom restore</h2>
<p>Custom restore allows you to upload a large amount of data to the selected environment without being restricted by the 2 GB <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#create-a-deployment-package">deployment package</a> limit. This process is primarily intended for initial deployments (e.g., when <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/upgrade-to-xperience-by-kentico">upgrading</a> to Xperience by Kentico).</p>
<p>Custom restore bypasses the regular deployment process and enables you to transfer the database and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage#azure-blob-storage-for-kenticos-saas">storage</a> files to the selected environment. It does not provide a way to deploy application libraries and therefore is not a full replacement for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment">deployments</a>.</p>
<p>During the process, you first upload the data to automatically created containers in Azure Storage that are separate from your SaaS environments. When you apply the custom restore, all existing data in the target environment’s database and storage is overwritten with the uploaded data, and the target environment is unavailable while the restore itself runs.</p>
<p>The changes introduced by a custom restore are not propagated between environments with the deployment package. Transferring them to other environments requires a custom restore for each environment.</p>
<h3 id="perform-a-custom-restore">Perform a custom restore</h3>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Only <strong>Tenant administrator</strong> and <strong>DevOps</strong> roles can manage custom restore sessions (create and close sessions, revoke access) and restore to all environments. <strong>Developers</strong> can restore to non-production environments (QA, UAT) and access the restore containers.</p>
</div>

<p>To perform a custom restore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Back up your data.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a <a href="#create-a-manual-restore-point">restore point</a> or an <a href="#create-a-manual-export">export</a> for the target environment before starting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a restore session.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Navigate to <strong>Data Management</strong> → <strong>Custom restore</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create session</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get access to restore containers.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Select <strong>Get access</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to restrict access to the restore containers, specify an allowlist by entering an IP address or an IP address range and confirm with <strong>Get access</strong>. Otherwise, select <strong>Get access</strong> without entering any values.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Copy both <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/delegate-access-with-shared-access-signature" target="_blank">SAS URLs</a> for the database and storage containers.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>SAS URLs</strong></p>
<p>You can’t retrieve the same SAS URLs again. However, you can get new SAS URLs with <strong>Get access</strong>. The previously existing SAS URLs are still valid. To revoke all current SAS URLs, select <strong>Revoke access</strong> under <strong>Current session</strong>.</p>
Within a session, the SAS URL pairs provide access to the same containers.
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload the database.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer" target="_blank">Azure Storage Explorer</a> to connect to the container:
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In Azure Storage Explorer, connect to the restore Azure Storage (select the type <em>Blob container or directory</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the connection through <em>Shared access signature URL (SAS)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the SAS URL for the database container and connect to the resource. The display name does not matter.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Upload the database exported as a <em>bacpac</em> file to the database container.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
The file must be named <code>db.bacpac</code>. The database to be restored must have the same version as the one currently in the environment. If these conditions are not met, the restore will not succeed.
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload storage files.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Connect to the storage container using the second SAS URL (as in the previous step).</li>
<li>Upload the files to be stored in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage#azure-blob-storage-for-kenticos-saas">Azure Blob Storage</a>.
<ul>
<li>Organize the files according to the Azure Blob Storage configuration of your project. You can obtain this structure by downloading a <strong>Storage and files</strong> <a href="#restore-points">export</a> once you have deployed with this Blob storage configuration.</li>
<li>For each container used in your Blob storage mapping, upload a folder with the same name. Within that folder, include the files arranged according to your project’s storage structure.
<ul>
<li>For example, if you’re using the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage#default-kentico-managed-azure-blob-storage-configuration">default configuration</a>, the structure would be <code>default/assets/…</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<div>

</div>
<div>
The uploaded files count toward the file storage limit, which you can view on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restore to an environment.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Make sure you have a backup of the target environment. The custom restore process itself cannot be undone, but you can use <a href="#restore-points">restore points</a> to revert the changes.</li>
<li>Once you have uploaded both the database and the storage files to be restored, you can select <strong>Restore to environment</strong> under <strong>Current session</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the target environment where the data should be restored. The environment will be unavailable during the restore process. The database in the target environment will be replaced with the uploaded one. All storage containers in the environment will be deleted and recreated based on the uploaded data.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create</strong> to start the custom restore process.</li>
</ol>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<strong>Tenant administrator</strong> and <strong>DevOps</strong> roles can restore to any environment. <strong>Developers</strong> can restore only to non-production environments (QA, UAT).
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the session.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>You can see the restore in progress under <strong>Active restores</strong>. Once finished, it will appear under <strong>Last completed restores</strong>.</li>
<li>When the restore process is complete and you no longer need to keep the data (for example, to restore it to another environment), <strong>Close</strong> the session.</li>
</ol>

<div>

</div>
<div>
Each session expires after a week. Once a session has expired, you can no longer upload data to the containers, but you can still restore the data you uploaded previously (up to 180 days from the session creation). Only one restore session can be open at a time.

<h3 id="alerts">Alerts</h3>
<p>Alerts notify about potential problems with applications deployed to the SaaS environment. Most of the available alerts are based on <a href="#performance-metrics">performance metrics,</a> such as application responses, server errors or CPU/memory/DTU utilization.</p>
<p>The system currently provides the following types of alerts:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Alert type</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Severity</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Alert conditions</p>

<p>To view alerts for your project’s deployments, navigate to <strong>Monitoring → Alerts</strong> in <a href="https://xperience-portal.com" target="_blank">Xperience Portal</a>. You can filter the alerts for individual deployment environments, based on the time when the alert was fired, and the alert severity.</p>
<p>Alerts are displayed with the <strong>Resolved</strong>  flag if the conditions that caused the alert to fire no longer apply. For example, a <em>CPU utilization</em> alert will be resolved after the average utilization drops under the 80% threshold over 30 minutes. Select <strong>Show active alerts only</strong> in the filter if you wish to see only unresolved alerts.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 id="alert-email-notifications">Alert email notifications</h4>
<p>Whenever an <a href="#alerts">alert</a> is fired, the system sends a notification email to all Xperience Portal users assigned to the related project.</p>
<p>Individual users can adjust their preferences for receiving alert email notifications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <a href="https://xperience-portal.com" target="_blank">Xperience Portal</a>, expand the top-right user menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li>
<li>Customize for which alert types and severities you want to receive email notifications from each <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-application-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deployment environment</a>.
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Note</strong>: The selected alert severity and alert type conditions are combined using an <em>AND</em> statement. If you select <em>Critical</em> alert severity and <em>CPU</em> alert type, you will not receive any alerts of alert types other than <em>CPU</em>. For <strong>Production</strong> and <strong>Staging</strong> environments, it is recommended to enable all alert types and at least <em>Critical</em> and <em>Error</em> alert severity.</li>
</ul>
