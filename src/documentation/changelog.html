<h3>Hotfix (July 3, 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>version 30.6.3</strong></p>

<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Azure storage – When using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage">Azure storage</a>, cleanup of Azure temporary and cache folders was performed inefficiently. Applying the hotfix changes how the cleanup process works and improves its performance. For existing projects that use <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage">Azure storage</a>, we recommend manually deleting the content of the <em>App_Data/AzureCache</em> and <em>App_Data/AzureTemp</em> folders before you redeploy with the hotfix applied.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Form Builder – If a selector <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">UI form component</a> (e.g., the <em>Tag selector</em>) was assigned to a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-components/form-component-properties">property</a> of a Form Builder form component, an error occurred when attempting to <em>Apply</em> the properties of form fields using the given Form Builder component.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span data-entry data-entry-issue>Performance</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/routing/content-tree-based-routing">content tree-based routing</a> generated unnecessary SQL queries. The database was only queried when a URL was accessed for the first time; all following requests for that same path were resolved using the cache.</li>
<li>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_scanner" target="_blank">vulnerability scanning tools</a> attempted to set the language parameter of the <em>/getContentAsset</em> endpoint to an invalid value, an unnecessary query to the database was made, and an error was logged in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/event-log">event log</a>. However, there are no known vulnerabilities related to this endpoint. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">SaaS – Deploying files with a path length (file name and directory structure) longer than 260 characters could, in certain cases, prevent <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-to-the-saas-environment">deployment to SaaS environments</a>.</span></p></li>

<h3>Hotfix (June 26, 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>version 30.6.2</strong></p>

<p>New features</p>
<div data-entry="" data-entry-feature="">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Model mapping improvements</strong></p>
<p>The system’s automatic <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api#run-queries-and-map-the-result">model mapping API</a> now supports a more flexible approach with relaxed restrictions on model classes. You can now use any non-abstract classes, structs, or records with a parameterless constructor for content mapping, without a corresponding registration via <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects#registercontenttypemapping-attribute">RegisterContentTypeMappingAttribute</a>. This allows you to create custom, simplified models with only the properties you need, and use registered and unregistered models together. The change applies broadly to all system APIs that use the mapping logic (<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api">Content item query</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api">IContentRetriever</a>).</p>
<p>When the automatic mapping falls back to an unregistered model, it follows the mapping behavior described in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api#using-getmappedresult-methods">the mapping documentation</a>. The result of the automatic mapping attempt can be further modified using custom logic.</p>
<p>Additionally, starting with this update we now recommend using <code>IContentQueryModelTypeMapper</code> instead of <code>IContentQueryResultMapper</code> for all content mapping scenarios. Corresponding documentation sections previously working with <code>IContentQueryResultMapper</code> were updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Page Builder – Using empty values in the <code>href</code> and <code>src</code> HTML attributes within <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> components could lead to styling issues in Page Builder edit mode.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Pages – When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> was enabled with the <code>cms.webpageurlpath</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/reference-ci-cd-object-types">object type</a> included, it was not possible to delete the last <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">language variant</a> of a <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">page</a> in the <em>Draft</em> step.</span></p></li>

<h3>Hotfix (June 19, 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>version 30.6.1</strong></p>

<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Custom admin UI – After updating a project to version 30.6.0, errors occurred when using custom or extended admin UI <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/reference-ui-page-templates/listing-ui-page-template">listing pages</a> provided by external libraries that reference Xperience NuGet packages 30.5.4 or older. The changes could cause runtime errors on listing pages in the admin UI (“Method not found” exceptions), when the external libraries called the <code>AddColumn()</code> or <code>AddComponentColumn()</code> methods. The issue affected listing pages from custom and community packages, as well as <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/third-party-integrations#external-packages">Xperience integrations</a> delivered via external packages. Applying this hotfix restores compatibility with external libraries.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Email Builder – If an <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#templates">Email Builder template</a> contained multiple editable areas, an error (“Sections rendering context is not in a valid state.” exception) could occur in certain scenarios when a widget that loaded content from the database was placed into a section within the first editable area. The error prevented the system from sending such emails, and users could not view the email in <em>Preview</em> mode.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Admin UI – In version 30.6.0, the <em>URLs</em> tab in the page editing UI sometimes did not show the correct domain name in the displayed <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls">page URLs</a>. The <em>Website domain</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#create-website-channels">value</a> set in the admin UI was used even when the domain set <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#domain-aliases-and-environment-specific-domains">programmatically</a> or through <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#manage-channel-domains-in-xperience-portal">Xperience Portal</a> should have been used instead.</span></p></li>

<h2>Refresh (June 12, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>version 30.6.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Multiple vanity URLs for pages</strong><br>
Each <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">page</a> can now have multiple <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls">vanity URLs</a>. Marketers can leverage this feature to create different URLs for different audiences. The <em>URLs</em> tab in the website channel’s page editing UI has been updated to better support managing a larger number of page URLs.</p>


<p><strong>Emergency deployments to SaaS environments</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-emergency-fixes-to-the-saas-environment">Emergency deployments</a> allow users to bypass the standard deployment flow and push critical fixes or version updates directly to SaaS environments other than <em>QA</em> (e.g., to <em>UAT</em> or even to <em>PROD</em>). This process allows users to rapidly deploy fixes even if the <em>QA</em> environment is “blocked“ by a currently developed feature.</p>


<p><strong>Email Builder widget personalization</strong><br>
Marketers can now create personalized variants of <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder#add-content-using-widgets">Email Builder widgets</a>. This allows you to increase the effectiveness of your emails, and deliver targeted content to email recipients based on the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact groups</a> to which they belong.</p>


<p><strong>Email Builder improvements</strong><br>
The following functionality was added to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder">Email Builder</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preset <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder/email-builder-templates">email templates</a> – You can now save default email templates and their Email Builder content as preset email templates. These preset email templates can then be used as a starting point for new emails.</li>
<li>Changing <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder/email-builder-templates">email templates</a> – Editors can now switch between different templates for emails created in Email Builder.</li>
<li>Component restrictions – The option to set widget or section restrictions was added to Email Builder components, ensuring better control and organization.</li>
<li>Copy functionality – You can now copy Email Builder components (<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#widgets">widgets</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#sections">sections</a>), and paste them in any emails where Email Builder is available.</li>
<li>Link pages and images – You can now link pages and images using the built-in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/inline-editors-email-builder-widgets#rich-text-inline-editor">inline rich text editor</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Email preview improvements</strong><br>
The option to switch between different views of an <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">email</a> was added to the <em>Preview</em> mode in email channels, enabling users to see how their email is going to look in the <em>desktop</em>, <em>mobile</em>, and <em>inbox</em> views. Additionally, users can copy the full HTML code of the email from <em>Preview</em> mode.</p>


<p><strong>In-product guidance via AIRA</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/aira">AIRA</a> now provides in-product guidance through a built-in chatbot interface, which uses <a href="/documentation/">Kentico’s Learn Portal</a> as the main source of information. Users can ask questions directly within the Xperience by Kentico administration to get feature explanations or best practice recommendations without leaving the application.</p>
<p>This feature is currently in an early preview stage. We welcome your feedback regarding its performance and the quality of the responses. Please send any comments or suggestions to <a href="mailto:aira@kentico.com" target="_self">aira@kentico.com</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Commerce order status changes and notifications</strong><br>
Digital commerce feature preview now enables users to set up <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/configure-order-statuses#create-order-statuses">order statuses</a>, set up <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/configure-order-statuses#configure-notifications-for-order-statuses">internal notifications on status transitions</a>, and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/manage-orders">manage orders</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="updates-and-changes" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p><strong>Preset page templates application replacement</strong><br>
The Refresh introduces a new <em>Preset templates</em> application that replaces the old <em>Preset page templates application</em>. The new application allows you to manage both <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/page-templates">page</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder/email-builder-templates">email</a> preset templates. Roles with permissions for the <em>Preset page templates</em> application have the same permissions for the <em>Preset templates</em> application. After applying the update, all <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages">custom admin UI pages</a> registered under <code>PageTemplatesApplication</code> will be registered under <code>PresetTemplatesApplication</code>, and the old application will be marked as obsolete.</p>


<p><strong>ContentRetriever API updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The API is no longer marked experimental and can be used freely across projects.</li>
<li>
<code>RetrieveContentByGuids&lt;TResult&gt;</code> now correctly handles mixed data returned by the combined content selector. The method also automatically ensures web page data for retrieved pages.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>GetListResult method update</strong><br>
A new <code>GetListResultAsync&lt;T&gt;</code> method was added to the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/objectquery-api">object query API</a>, which provides an async variant of the <code>GetListResult&lt;T&gt;</code> method. Additionally, the inner implementation of the existing method was also updated, resulting in improved performance.</p>


<p><strong>Email Builder in the Dancing Goat project template</strong><br>
The <em>Dancing Goat</em> sample project template was extended to include an <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder">Email Builder</a> demo, with several basic <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components">Email Builder</a> components.</p>


<p><strong>Rich text editor plugin registration API</strong><br>
The registration API for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/rich-text-editor-configuration/rich-text-editor-plugins#implement-custom-plugins">custom rich text editor plugins</a> was extended to provide the <code>froalaEditorConfigurator.configureOptions</code> method, which allows dynamic adjustments of the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/rich-text-editor-configuration">editor configuration</a>.</p>


<p><strong>All content GUIDs and IDs accessible through UI</strong><br>
The <em>Information</em> section on the <em>Properties</em> tab now also displays <em>Content item ID</em> and <em>Content item GUID</em> for <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">content items</a>, <em>Content item GUID</em> and <em>Page GUID</em> for <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">pages</a>, and <em>Headless item ID</em> and <em>Headless item GUID</em> for <a href="/documentation/business-users/headless-content">headless items</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Listing pages support tooltips for columns</strong><br>
The method <code>PageConfiguration.ColumnConfigurations.AddColumn()</code> now supports rendering tooltips for columns on <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/reference-ui-page-templates/listing-ui-page-template">listing pages</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="new-object-types-for-cicd" data-section="" data-section-ci-cd="">
<h3>New object types for CI/CD</h3>

<p>The update introduces the following object types, which are supported by the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> features. Consider updating the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories">repository.config</a> files of your CI/CD repositories, particularly when using the <code>&lt;IncludedObjectTypes&gt;</code> allowlist for object type filtering.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>emaillibrary.emailpresettemplate</code> – Email Builder configuration of saved <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder/email-builder-templates">preset email templates</a>.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>API – In certain cases, the <code>ContextUtils.PropagateCurrent</code> method didn’t correctly <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/integrate-custom-code#database-connection-issues-when-scheduling-parallel-or-asynchronous-work-from-external-libraries">pass context values</a> to tasks managed in custom code, which could lead to exceptions when awaiting tasks using <code>Task.WhenAll</code>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigating to a different page or menu item in the administration interface before the current page was finished loading could result in an error, particularly on slower connections.</li>
<li>Rendering of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components">Admin UI form components</a> in read-only mode was improved by fixing minor visual issues. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Channels – A newly created channel (website, email, headless) could, in some cases, not be visible as an application on the administration dashboard due to being incorrectly cached.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Email Builder</p>
<ul>
<li>If an <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#sections">Email Builder section</a> contained multiple widget zones, an error (“The connection does not support MultipleActiveResultSets.” exception) could occur if a widget that loaded content from the database was placed into two or more of the zones. The error prevented the system from sending such emails, and users could not view the email in <em>Preview</em> mode.</li>
<li>When developing <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#sections">Email Builder sections</a> with <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#mjml-markup">MJML components</a>, widget zones placed within <code>&lt;mj-column&gt;</code> elements were not correctly placed within the resulting HTML table element in the Email Builder view mode. This could cause issues with component positioning or styling in certain cases. The issue did not affect content in <em>Preview</em> mode or the actual emails sent to recipients.</li>
<li>When using MJML markup for Email Builder components, CSS classes assigned to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#mjml-markup">MJML components</a> (via the <code>css-class</code> attribute) weren’t rendered for the resulting HTML elements in the Email Builder view mode. This could cause components to appear without styling. The issue did not affect content in <em>Preview</em> mode or the actual emails sent to recipients. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Forms – If a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms">form</a> contained fields with long <em>Label</em> text, the listing header in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/manage-form-submissions">Submissions</a> view mode overlapped the first row of the displayed form submissions. After applying the update, long label text values are truncated in the listing header.</p></li>
<li><p>Rich text editor – An error occurred when inserting an asset using the <em>Insert image</em> and <em>Insert link</em> dialogs in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a> if no asset was selected to be inserted.</p></li>
<li><p>SaaS – The daily cap for the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/saas-configuration#enable-microsoft-application-insights-integration">Microsoft Application Insights integration</a> was modified to prevent a situation where a persisting issue could prevent the project from logging any new entries after the cap is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Xperience Portal – Attempting to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#add-website-channel-domains-with-minimal-downtime">pre-validate</a> an invalid domain name caused minor inconsistencies in the system.</p></li>

<h3>Hotfix (June 5, 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>version 30.5.4</strong></p>

<p>Updates and changes</p>
<div data-entry="" data-entry-update="">
<p><strong>Allowed depth of field cycles in headless content</strong><br>
Xperience version 30.1.0 updated the <em>Hot Chocolate</em> GraphQL server used for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management">headless channels</a> to <a href="https://chillicream.com/blog/2024/08/30/hot-chocolate-14" target="_blank">version 14</a>, which introduced extra security features, such as <em>Maximum allowed field cycle depth</em> validation. The default configuration had the cycle depth limit set to 3 and was enforced in non-development environments.</p>
<p>This hotfix (30.5.4) changes the default depth limit to 5, enforces the rule the same way on all environments, and provides the ability to customize the <code>MaxFieldCycleDepth</code> via <code>HeadlessOptions</code>. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management#configure-the-headless-api">Configure the headless API</a>.</p>
<p>Since the validation for maximum allowed depth of field cycles is now enforced in development environments, deeply recursive GraphQL queries may now start failing with a <em>Maximum allowed coordinate cycle depth was exceeded</em> error. Manually adjust the <code>MaxFieldCycleDepth</code> configuration if you encounter this error.</p>

<h2>Refresh (May 19, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>version 30.5.0</strong></p>
<section id="manual-update-steps" data-section="" data-section-special="">
<h3>Manual update steps</h3>

<p>The update introduces an internal system <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">user</a> with the <em>kentico-system-service</em> username, which is used by the new <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-sync">content synchronization</a> feature.</p>
<p>If your project already contains a custom user with this username, you need to remove this user before starting the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects">update</a>. Otherwise an error will occur, and you will need to re-run the update on an unmodified backup of your project and database.</p>
<p>If you have a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/saas-overview">SaaS</a> project or use the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> feature, you need to ensure that your <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories">repository.config</a> files include the <code>cms.user</code> object type. Otherwise the new system user will not be deployed after you perform the update. The update also requires you to use the <code>CreateUpdate</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories#configure-cd-restore-mode">CD restore mode</a> (<code>Create</code> is not sufficient).</p>

</section>
<section id="new-features-1" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Content synchronization</strong><br>
Content sync allows users to easily transfer content from one instance of Xperience by Kentico to another. The purpose of content sync is to help manage content when using multiple environments. For example, a project’s developers may have a local <em>Development</em> instance, from which initial content is sent to a hosted <em>Staging</em> instance. The staging instance is accessible only by editors and other staff, who use it to prepare content updates. The final content is then synchronized during regular releases to a public-facing <em>Production</em> instance. For more information, see <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-sync">Content sync</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/content-sync-configuration">Content sync configuration</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Staging environment for SaaS</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/saas-overview">SaaS</a> projects now offer the option to add a <em>Staging</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-application-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deployment environment</a>, which provides a platform where editors and other staff can prepare content, and then transfer it to the production environment using the new content sync feature. Staging environments are designed to be nearly identical to production environments in most aspects, such as performance, availability, backup policies, and the option to set custom domains.</p>


<p><strong>Pre-validation of DNS records for website channel domains in SaaS</strong><br>
To help ensure a smoother transition when assigning a new main domain to your website channel, it is now possible to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#add-custom-website-channel-domains">pre-validate the required DNS records</a>. This enhancement minimizes downtime during the domain update process.</p>


<p><strong>Improved email field retrieval in Email Builder components</strong><br>
The update introduces a new API for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#email-fields">retrieving content from email fields</a> within Email Builder components, including support for all available field data types.</p>


<p><span id="EnhancedPageURLRetrieval"></span> <strong>Enhanced page URL retrieval</strong><br>
This update improves <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-page-content/retrieve-page-urls">URL retrieval</a> functionality with several optimizations and new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <code>GetUrl()</code> extension method for models implementing <code>IWebPageFieldsSource</code> that provides a URL retrieval option that never queries the database for additional data. The interface is by default implemented by all <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects">generated page classes</a>.</li>
<li>A specialized <code>UrlPathColumns()</code> method for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api">content item query</a> that includes columns required for URL path generation. Useful when query data is restricted via <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query#columns">Columns()</a>.</li>
<li>Control over <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-page-content/retrieve-page-urls#using-the-geturl-extension-method">URL language behavior</a> via the new <code>SetUrlLanguageBehavior</code> method, allowing developers to decide if URLs for fallback language pages should use the requested language path structure or the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages#language-fallbacks">fallback language</a> structure.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Content retriever API</strong><br>
This update introduces multiple changes to the experimental <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api">IContentRetriever</a> API.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Caching support</strong> – The <code>IContentRetriever</code> API now supports result caching. Caching is enabled by default for all retrieval methods and can be configured using the <code>RetrievalCacheSettings</code> parameter. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api#implicit-result-caching">Implicit result caching</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>New retrieval methods using GUIDs</strong> – The ContentRetriever API now contains two new methods that enable retrieving content directly using GUIDs: <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-retriever-api#retrieve-pages-by-guids">RetrievePagesByGuids</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-retriever-api#retrieve-content-items-by-guids">RetrieveContentByGuids</a>. These methods are useful for situations when you have specific content item identifiers, such as from related items fields or selectors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Option to provide configuration defaults</strong> – <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api#configurable-retrieval-behavior">Parameter classes</a> within the ContentRetriever API, such as <code>RetrieveAllPagesParameters</code> now include a static <code>Default</code> property. This property provides a default instance of the specific parameter type when no custom configuration is needed. A similar <code>Default</code> property was added to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api#optional-query-configuration">query parameterization</a> classes. In this context, <code>Default</code> returns a null action, representing no additional configuration. Useful when a configuration action is syntactically required but no additional configuration is necessary (for instance, when using certain advanced overloads of the available methods).</li>
<li>
<strong>Obtain used cache dependencies</strong> – The API now includes <code>CacheDependencyCollector</code> for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/caching/cache-dependencies">cache dependency</a> management. This class automatically collects dependencies for items retrieved via <code>IContentRetriever</code> calls within a scoped context. Access collected dependencies using <code>GetCacheDependency()</code> for broader caching strategies, like caching multiple retrieval calls under a single section. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api#implicit-result-caching">Implicit result caching</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Web page data for linked items included by default in results</strong> – The API now defaults to including full web page data, such as URL paths, for linked content items retrieved via content queries by internally using the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query#withwebpagedata">WithWebPageData</a> parameterization.</li>
<li>
<strong>URL retrieval behavior</strong> – The <code>IContentRetriever</code> API now also provides the URL enhancements introduced by <a href="#EnhancedPageURLRetrieval">Enhanced page URL retrieval</a>. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api#url-retrieval-behavior">URL retrieval behavior</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Page usages</strong><br>
You can now see all the <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/track-page-usages">usages</a> of your website channel pages using the new page usage listing tab. This feature enables you to confidently manage, delete, and edit your pages, knowing exactly what other content you may influence.</p>


<p><strong>Scheduled recalculation of customer journey results</strong><br>
You can now <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/customer-journeys#CJScheduledRecalculation">schedule recalculation</a> of a customer journey to keep the journey results automatically up to date.</p>

</section>
<section id="updates-and-changes-1" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p><strong>Former URLs application replaced by a new URLs application</strong><br>
The Refresh introduces a new <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls">URLs</a> application that replaces the <em>Former URLs</em> application. The new application includes a <em>Former URLs</em> tab, preserving the original functionality, and adds a <em>Vanity URLs</em> tab that provides an overview of <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls#manage-vanity-urls-of-pages">vanity URLs</a>. Roles with permissions for the <em>Former URLs</em> application have the same permissions for the <em>URLs</em> application. After applying the update, all <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages">custom pages</a> registered under <code>FormerUrlsApp</code> will be registered under the new <em>URLs</em> application. The URL slug for the new application is <code>urls</code>, with the <em>Former URLs</em> tab available under <code>urls/former-urls</code>.</p>


<p><strong>Read-only mode</strong><br>
The Refresh introduces read-only mode for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components">Admin UI form components</a>, allowing the components to be displayed as editable, disabled, or read-only. The system now uses read-only mode when users view previously published versions in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-versioning#version-history">version history</a>. <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components#create-custom-form-components">Custom UI form components</a> should implement read-only mode support using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components#form-component-front-end">custom logic</a>.</p>


<p><strong>LinkedItemsDependencyRetriever API</strong><br>
The <a href="https://api-reference.kentico.com/api/CMS.ContentEngine.ILinkedItemsDependencyAsyncRetriever.html" target="_blank">ILinkedItemsDependencyRetriever</a> API newly builds and returns <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/caching/cache-dependencies">dependencies</a> on <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schemas</a> if any items for which dependencies are requested use them.</p>


<p><strong>Content item usages</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#track-usage-of-content-items">content item usages</a> tab has been enhanced to display usages in a hierarchical structure, sharing the design with the new <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/track-page-usages">page usages</a> feature.</p>


<p><strong>AIRA Companion app upgrade available</strong><br>
A new version of the AIRA Companion app integration is available. The app is still available only as a preview. Users can now select from pre-made prompts when using the chatbot. Mock messages can now be used when integrating and testing the app. See the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-aira-unified" target="_blank">Xperience by Kentico Aira Unified</a> GitHub repository for more details.</p>


<p><strong>Form context in validation rules</strong><br>
A <code>FormContext</code> property was added to the <code>ValidationRule</code> base class. This enables developers to evaluate <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-validation-rules">validation rules</a> based on the context where the UI form is displayed. For example, you can limit a validation rule to be used only in the UI forms of content items.</p>

<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<p><strong>Command events in UI page extenders</strong><br>
The option to handle UI page command events in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-page-extenders">UI page extenders</a> was deprecated. The related <code>PageExtender&lt;TPage&gt;.CommandExecute</code> property and <code>PageCommandEventArgs</code> class are now obsolete. This customization pattern was difficult to use without internal knowledge of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-page-commands">UI page commands</a>, and will be removed without a direct replacement. However, endpoints for relevant customization scenarios may be added to individual UI pages in the future.</p>


<p><strong>Deprecated properties in <span data-cites="kentico/xperience-admin-components">@kentico/xperience-admin-components</span> package</strong><br>
The <code>disabled</code> property in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components#add-support-for-form-field-metadata">FormItemWrapper</a>, which is used to wrap <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-react-input-components">React front-end input components</a> when creating <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components">custom UI form components</a> to ensure they work correctly on <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-pages-with-forms">UI pages with forms</a>, was made deprecated and replaced by <code>editMode</code>. The <code>disabled</code> property is backward compatible but will be removed in future versions.</p>


<p><strong>EmailContext.EmailFields for Email Builder components</strong><br>
The <code>EmailContext.EmailFields</code> property, which allows retrieval of email field values within <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components">Email Builder components</a>, is now obsolete. Instead, use the new <code>EmailContext.GetEmail&lt;T&gt;</code> method together with <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects">generated classes</a> for email content types. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#email-fields">Email fields</a>.</p>

<h3>Manual update steps</h3>

<p>When updating from versions older than <a href="/documentation/changelog#refresh-july-25-2024">version 29.3.0</a>, which introduced the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#track-usage-of-content-items">usage tracking feature</a>, use the new <em>Track missing content item usages</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/scheduled-tasks">scheduled task</a> to track missing content item usages. The tracking of existing references is no longer done automatically during the update.</p>

</section>
<section id="new-features-2" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>New content retrieval APIs</strong><br>
This update introduces a new, experimental <code>IContentRetriever</code> API designed to provide a unified approach for fetching content within Xperience web applications. This service abstracts common <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api">content query</a> patterns to simplify the retrieval of pages, reusable content items, and items using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schemas</a>. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api">ContentRetriever API</a> for a detailed overview of the API.</p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Simplified retrieval for common scenarios</em> – The API handles general retrieval cases (current page, all pages/items of a specific type, etc.) with optimized defaults for query construction, language fallback handling, and linked item retrieval, making basic fetching straightforward.</li>
<li>
<em>Configurable behavior</em> – Optional parameter objects allow developers to easily override default behaviors for specific needs, such as forcing language variants, enabling preview mode, including linked items, or filtering by page path.</li>
<li>
<em>Query customization</em> – In more complex retrieval scenarios, you can directly access the underlying <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api#build-queries">content query builder</a>, enabling custom filtering, sorting, projections, and paging.</li>
<li>
<em>Flexible model mapping</em> – You can override the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api#run-queries-and-map-the-result">default model mapping process</a>, transforming the raw retrieved data (<code>IContentQueryDataContainer</code>) into custom view models or applying specific logic beyond the default property mapping.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Enhanced CI/CD repository configuration</strong><br>
This release introduces a new version (v2) for <em>repository.config</em> files used by the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd">Continuous Integration &amp; Continuous Deployment</a> (CI/CD) feature. The new version brings enhanced control over repository content, particularly for content items. You can now precisely control which content items are included or excluded from the CI/CD repository using dedicated configuration elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Type-based filtering</em> – Use the new <code>&lt;IncludedContentItemsOfType&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ExcludedContentItemsOfType&gt;</code> elements to manage content items based on their <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content type</a>.</li>
<li>
<em>Name-based filtering</em> – Use the new <code>&lt;ContentItemFilters&gt;</code> element with <code>&lt;IncludedContentItemNames&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ExcludedContentItemNames&gt;</code> to filter individual content items by their code name patterns, including wildcard (%) support. This filtering applies <em>after</em> type-based filtering.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>repository.config</em> files generated via <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration#store-object-data-to-the-repository">kxp-ci-store</a> or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment#generate-cd-configuration-files">kxp-cd-config</a> now use this new format by default.</p>
<p>The existing <em>repository.config</em> format remains backward-compatible. However, migrating existing <em>repository.config</em> files to the v2 format is <em>required</em> if you wish to leverage the new advanced filtering capabilities described above, benefit from improved CD restore performance (particularly in the <code>CreateUpdate</code> mode), or ensure compatibility with potential future updates that rely on the v2 structure. If you choose to migrate, follow the steps outlined in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories/config-v2-migration">Migrate CI/CD repository.config to v2</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the product documentation now contains sample repository configurations that address common CI/CD scenarios. These are suitable as a starter that can be adapted to project-specific workflows. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories/repository-configuration-templates">Repository configuration templates</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Cache dependency support for reusable field schemas</strong><br>
You can now configure cache dependencies that are tied directly to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schemas</a> and their usage within content items or pages. When a schema or any item using a targeted schema is modified, created, or deleted, corresponding cache entries associated with this dependency are automatically invalidated. See the following pages for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/caching/cache-dependencies#reusable-field-schemas">Cache dependencies – reusable field schemas</a></li>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/caching/cache-dependencies#pages-reusableFieldSchemaUsage">Cache dependencies – pages reusable field schema usage</a></li>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/caching/cache-dependencies#contentItems-reusableFieldSchemaUsage">Cache dependencies – content items reusable field schema usage</a></li>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/caching/cache-dependencies-reference#reusable-field-schemas">Reusable field schemas cache dependencies reference</a></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Request context-aware CacheDependencyBuilder methods</strong><br>
To streamline <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/caching/cache-dependencies">cache dependency</a> configuration in web applications, especially in multichannel and multilingual environments, several new <em>context-aware extension methods</em> have been added to the <code>CacheDependencyBuilder</code> API. These methods automatically use channel and/or language information derived from the current HTTP request, reducing the need for manual context retrieval and parameter passing.</p>
<p>These enhancements simplify development and help ensure cache invalidation keys accurately reflect the specific context (channel, language) of the data being cached. Primary benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Automatic context resolution</em> – No need to manually fetch <code>IWebsiteChannelContext</code> or <code>IPreferredLanguageRetriever</code> in many common dependency scenarios.</li>
<li>
<em>Improved accuracy</em> – Ensures dependencies are correctly scoped to the relevant channel and/or language variant presented to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>These extension methods are available in the <code>Kentico.Content.Web.Mvc</code> namespace when building cache dependencies with <code>ForContentItems</code> or <code>ForWebPageItems</code>.</p>


<p><strong>Async object events</strong><br>
The update introduces a new event handling approach for the most common object events – <em>Insert</em>, <em>Update</em> and <em>Delete</em> (triggered when an object in the system is created, updated or deleted). The new object event handlers allow developers to use both synchronous and asynchronous code, and support standard constructor dependency injection. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/handle-global-events/handle-object-events">Handle object events</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Digital commerce developer preview</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup">digital commerce</a> feature is released as a preview for developers. In this release, you can explore the commerce implementation in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation#available-project-templates">Dancing Goat</a> sample site, which currently contains a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/model-product-catalog">product catalog</a> and a sample handling of the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/implement-checkout-process">shopping cart</a>. After completing a purchase on the website, you can view the resulting <em>Customers</em> and <em>Orders</em> in their respective applications.</p>


<p><strong>Customizable system email sender and service domains in SaaS deployments</strong><br>
You can now <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration#configurable-sender-email-addresses">customize</a> the sender address for system emails and the email service domain in projects deployed to the SaaS environment in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal">Xperience Portal</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Image dimension limits</strong><br>
You can now set a limit to the maximum width or height of an image asset when <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types#automatically-optimize-image-assets">automatic image conversion</a> is enabled for its content type. Images exceeding the set limits are automatically resized to fit upon upload.</p>


<p><strong>Copy asset URLs</strong><br>
To use <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">content item assets</a> stored in Xperience across different platforms (such as social media), you can now <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#copy-an-asset-url">copy the URL</a> of a published asset or image variant.</p>


<p><strong>Improvements for customer journeys</strong><br>
Several visual improvements were made to <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/customer-journeys">customer journeys</a>, which now also allow you to easily view which contacts <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/customer-journeys#view-converted-and-dropped-off-contacts">converted or dropped off</a> at a given stage.</p>


<p><strong>Expanded email personalization</strong><br>
The update improves the personalization options for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">email</a> content. In older versions, <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails#personalize-emails-with-dynamic-text">dynamic text</a> could only be added into rich text fields. Now users can insert personalization placeholders into all types of text fields. These placeholders represent attributes of the email’s recipient, such as their name or email address. When the email is sent, the placeholders are replaced by appropriate values for the given recipient.</p>

<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p><strong>Customer journeys</strong><br>
When a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/customer-journeys">customer journey</a> starts recalculating, the journey results are temporarily cleared until the recalculation finishes to prevent inconsistencies in the UI.</p>


<p><strong>Froala editor update</strong><br>
The <a href="https://froala.com/wysiwyg-editor" target="_blank">Froala WYSIWYG editor</a> that provides the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">Rich text editor</a> in Xperience was updated to version 4.5.1. See Froala Editor <a href="https://froala.com/blog/editor/new-releases/froala-editor-v4-5-1-enhanced-filestack-styling-non-editable-content-and-more/" target="_blank">4.5.1</a> for details.</p>


<p><strong>Improved image zooming in the Adjust the image dialog</strong><br>
You can now control the zoom level of an edited <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">image</a> in the <em>Adjust the image</em> dialog using the mouse wheel or touchpad pinch gesture.</p>


<p><strong>Page Builder data visible in version history</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> data is now visible when viewing a previously published version of a page in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-versioning#version-history">version history</a>.</p>


<p><strong>WorkspaceEvaluatePermission attribute made public</strong><br>
The <code>WorkspaceEvaluatePermission</code> attribute was made public. This attribute allows users to place <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages">UI pages</a> in workspace-scoped applications behind permissions.</p>

<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<p><strong>Application.PostStart event</strong><br>
The <code>Application.PostStart</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/handle-global-events/reference-global-system-events">global event</a> is now obsolete. This approach is no longer recommended for running post application startup actions.</p>


<p><strong>Disabled property in form components replaced by EditMode property</strong><br>
The <code>Disabled</code> properties below were made obsolete and are now replaced by the <code>EditMode</code> property:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>IFormComponentClientPropertie.Disabled</code></li>
<li><code>IFormComponentProperties.Disabled</code></li>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-2" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Admin UI – If the selection dialog was opened for a field using the <em>Combined content selector</em> form component while one or more items were already selected, the dialog performed unnecessary loading, which could lower the performance of the admin UI in the browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Admin UI customization – Using the <code>UIPermission</code> attribute in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-page-extenders">UI page extenders</a> to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-page-permission-checks#ui-permission-model-and-page-extenders">add required permissions</a> didn’t work if the extended page was deeper than the first level of the given application’s UI page tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Assets – Upload of large files (hundreds of MB) to <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">content item asset</a> fields could fail in certain cases (with a <code>SystemOutOfMemoryException</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Azure storage – When using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage">Azure storage</a>, the system inefficiently processed files when cleaning Azure temporary and cache folders. When a very large number of files were present, this process could lead to a timeout, which caused the application to become unresponsive.</p></li>
<li><p>CI/CD – Records in the <em>CMS_WebPageAclMapping</em> table were not restored properly in the <code>Create</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories#configure-cd-restore-mode">CD restore mode</a>, potentially resulting in missing <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/page-permission-management">page permissions</a>. After updating, any missing records are restored.</p></li>
<li><p>Content items – When a page containing <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> data was cloned, references to <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">content items</a> from the Page Builder were not properly tracked until the page was saved or published from the <em>Page Builder</em> tab. As a result, these content items did not appear on the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#track-usage-of-content-items">Usage tab</a>, and they were not available for <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#cascade-publishing">cascade publishing</a> if they were still in the <em>Draft</em> step.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer journeys – The displayed time of the latest <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/customer-journeys">customer journey</a> calculation didn’t automatically update after a journey <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/customer-journeys#recalculate-a-customer-journey">recalculation</a> finished.</p></li>
<li><p>Email Builder – Relative URLs weren’t resolved correctly when working with emails in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder">Email Builder UI</a>. For example, this prevented images from being displayed within the content of Email Builder widgets. The URLs were resolved correctly when the email was sent to recipients or opened in <em>Preview</em> mode.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Pages – The content tree of <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">website channels</a> didn’t correctly display:</p>
<ul>
<li>the status of pages in a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/workflows">custom workflow step</a> or pages scheduled for <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#scheduled-publishing">publishing</a> or <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#unpublish-pages">unpublishing</a>
</li>
<li>the <em>Not translated</em> status of folders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>SaaS deployment – When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-application-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deploying a package</a> to any new environment, the file system of the environment’s App Service is now cleared to improve the reliability of the deployment process.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Users</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlock links contained in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management#account-lockout">account lockout</a> notification emails were not correctly invalidated after they were used to unlock a user account.</li>
<li>When a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">user</a> signed in to the administration, the <code>LastLogon</code> value wasn’t updated for the user. This value can only be viewed in the <em>CMS_User</em> database table or accessed via <code>UserInfo.LastLogon</code> in the API.</li>
<li>When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management#invite-users">inviting</a> new administration users, a validation error occurred if the new user’s email address contained special characters, for example ‘+’. After applying the update, the invitation is sent correctly and any unsupported characters are replaced in the resulting user name. </li>

<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Email Builder production release</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder">Email Builder</a> feature was extended to support the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The option to build, save and send <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> with the <em>Automation</em> or <em>Regular</em> purposes.
<ul>
<li>Note: Any existing emails with an Email Builder template and another purpose (<em>Form autoresponder</em> or <em>Confirmation</em>) are not supported. If you have created such emails in the previous developer preview version, we recommend deleting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configurable properties for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#sections">section</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#templates">template</a> components.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/inline-editors-email-builder-widgets">Inline editors</a> for widget properties, including a rich text editor by default.</li>
<li>Improved <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#access-contextual-information-in-components">email context</a>, which allows developers to access the data of the current email in component code, including the fields defined by the email’s content type and the unsubscription link for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">regular emails</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Content versioning</strong><br>
The system now stores previously published versions of pages, reusable content items, and headless content items when <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-versioning">content versioning</a> is <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/content-versioning-configuration">enabled</a>. Users can browse the version history and restore previous versions. Version history also tracks when a page was unpublished, when it was scheduled to be published or unpublished, and when these scheduled actions were canceled.</p>


<p><strong>AIRA image processing</strong><br>
When <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#mass-asset-upload">mass uploading</a> images, AIRA can now automatically <a href="/documentation/business-users/aira#automatically-generate-image-description">generate descriptions</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/aira#automatically-assign-tags-to-images">assign tags</a> based on the image content.</p>

<p><strong>Page search</strong><br>
Editors can now find their desired pages more easily in a <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">website channel’s content tree</a> using the new search button. The resulting pages are listed in the same format as pages in the content tree.</p>


<p><strong>API for managing redirects</strong><br>
The system now provides new <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/routing/custom-redirects">API</a> for managing redirects that consists of <code>IWebPageRedirectManager</code> interface with one method <code>CreateOrUpdateRedirect</code>. The API can be useful during upgrades or when adjusting redirects from deleted pages. For managing redirects from unpublished pages, use existing methods in <code>IWebPageManager</code>.</p>

<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>If a field with the <em>Integer number</em> (<code>int</code>) data type used the <em>Maximum value</em> or <em>Minimum value</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-validation-rules">validation rule</a>, a validation error was displayed when an empty value was submitted, even if the field wasn’t required and allowed empty (<code>null</code>) values.</li>
<li>If a <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#content-folders">content folder</a> with a very long name was selected in the Content hub listing or combined content selector, the information bar displayed when searching could be displayed with a broken layout.</li>
<li>The <em>Save</em> button was incorrectly disabled after a validation error occurred in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#combined-content-selector">combined content selector</a> UI form component.</li>
<li>The name of the <em>Log object and page actions</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/event-log#configure-the-event-log">event log setting</a> and its description incorrectly stated that it enables logging of page actions.</li>
<li>When creating a new <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#smart-folders">smart folder</a> in the <em>Content hub</em> application, an infinite reload occurred in the <em>Save as smart folder</em> dialog (an error was also logged in the browser console).</li>
<li>When the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub#configure-content-hub-listing">listing configuration</a> panel was open in the <em>Content hub</em> application, the left navigation menu couldn’t be used to open another application until the panel was closed. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Admin UI authentication – The <em>Keep me signed in</em> option on the sign-in page of the Xperience administration didn’t work if <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management#multi-factor-authentication">Multi-factor authentication</a> was enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Admin UI customization – When creating custom admin <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-pages-with-forms">UI pages</a> that allowed users to create new objects, default values configured in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types#define-editing-forms">UI forms</a> for fields with a reference data type (e.g., <em>Pages</em> or <em>Media files</em>) weren’t loaded correctly on the resulting UI page. As a result, default selected objects couldn’t be configured for fields with a selector form component.</p></li>
<li><p>Application startup – During startup, if the application failed to load a referenced assembly whose full file system path was longer than 100 characters, the application raised an unhandled event log-related exception <code>Value cannot be longer than 100 characters. (Parameter 'eventCode')</code> instead of logging the original issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Assets – The <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#image-variants">image variant</a> listing incorrectly displayed the code name of variants instead of their display name.</p></li>
<li><p>CI/CD – The order of serialized <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/reference-ci-cd-object-types#binding-object-types">content item references</a> was non-deterministic and could indicate changes in serialized files even if no changes were made.</p></li>
<li><p>Content hub – Mass actions in the <em>Content hub</em> application were only applied to <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">content items</a> from the currently selected <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#content-folders">content folder</a>, even if items from other folders were also selected.</p></li>
<li><p>Cookies – The cookies used for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">admin UI authentication</a> were registered with an incorrect <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/cookies#cookie-levels">cookie level</a>, which could cause users to be signed out of the administration after setting or changing their cookie level on the live site.</p></li>
<li><p>Form Builder – If a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">form’s</a> output code included the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset" target="_blank">&lt;fieldset&gt;</a> HTML tag (for example added via a custom <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-sections">Form Builder section</a>), an error occurred when attempting to select a file in a form field using the <em>Upload file</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/reference-form-builder-components">component</a>.</p></li>

<h2>Refresh (February 20, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>version 30.2.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-4" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Image variants</strong><br>
Administrators can now <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types#configure-image-variants">configure image variants</a> with fixed dimensions, that marketers can further adjust to fit their needs. An <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#image-variants">image variant</a> is a cropped version of the primary image, created around its focal point. If you have access to <a href="/documentation/business-users/aira">AIRA features</a> in your project, AIRA can <a href="/documentation/business-users/aira#automatically-select-image-focal-point">automatically select the focal point</a> in the image, automating the task for content editors.</p>
<p>To efficiently work with image variants in your website’s code, use the new <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/reference-tag-helpers">image Tag Helpers</a>.</p>
<p>If your project contains image assets created before updating to <a href="#refresh-december-12-2024">version 30.0.0</a>, ensure that you run the <em>Calculate dimensions of image assets</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/scheduled-tasks">scheduled task</a> if you haven’t already, as image variants depend on asset dimensions.</p>


<p><strong>Content type scoping for pages</strong><br>
Administrators can now control which <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a> users can use to create pages in individual parts of a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a>. The content types can be configured using a global parent/child relationship for a given content type or for specified paths (scopes) in the website channel’s content tree. For more information, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/limit-the-pages-users-can-create">Limit the pages users can create</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Notifications for form submissions</strong><br>
The system can now be configured to send <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/notifications#form-submission-notifications">notifications</a> to administration users about <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">forms</a> that visitors submit on the live site.</p>


<p><strong>Email Builder developer preview</strong><br>
Email Builder allows editors to create <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> in a user-friendly visual interface using predefined components. These components are implemented by developers as described in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder">Email Builder</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The Email Builder feature is released in <em>developer preview</em> mode and is not fully functional. Currently, the feature’s main purpose is to allow technical users to familiarize themselves with the development process for Email Builder components. You can test components in the Email Builder UI, but cannot save the content and send the emails.</p>


<p><strong>Automatic DDoS detection for SaaS deployments</strong><br>
Projects deployed to the SaaS environment can now automatically detect and mitigate DDoS attacks via the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/saas-configuration#cloudflare-cdn">Cloudflare CDN</a>. An <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments#alerts">alert</a> is also created to notify users about recent DDoS attacks.</p>


<p><strong>AIRA Companion app preview</strong><br>
The AIRA Companion app is a new integration that provides an alternative interface to Xperience by Kentico designed for mobile devices. The application includes AIRA chat, where users can ask questions about the selected non-personal data stored in the system and also pose general questions. This integration is currently available only as a preview. The complementary <a href="https://community.kentico.com/blog/expanding-dxp-beyond-boundaries" target="_blank">blog post</a> provides more information and explains how to request access to the preview. The code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-aira-unified" target="_blank">Xperience by Kentico Aira Unified</a> GitHub repository.</p>


<p><strong>Xperience by Kentico API Reference</strong><br>
An API Reference for Xperience by Kentico is now available at <a href="http://api-reference.kentico.com" target="_blank">http://api-reference.kentico.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p><strong>Improved DataProtection API for SaaS deployments</strong></p>
<p>In previous Xperience by Kentico versions (30.1.3 and older), users working on projects deployed in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/saas-overview">SaaS environment</a> encountered issues where they were signed out of the Xperience administration interface with an error after a new deployment. To resolve this issue, a new implementation of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/introduction" target="_blank">ASP.NET DataProtection API</a> was introduced and can be enabled by calling the <code>IServiceCollection.AddXperienceCloudDataProtection</code> method when building the web application.</p>
<p>The new implementation is automatically enabled in all new projects installed with version 30.2.0 or newer. When updating existing projects, you need to enable it manually. We recommend enabling this feature in all SaaS projects unless you have your own custom implementation of the ASP.NET DataProtecton API.</p>

<p><strong>Cloning all language variants of a page</strong></p>
<p>When <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/create-pages#clone-a-page">cloning</a> a page, it’s now possible to clone all <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/translate-pages">language variants</a> of the page at once. This is now the default behavior. Cloning just one language variant is still possible, either by selecting this option in the UI or by setting the <code>CloneAllLanguageVariants</code> property of <code>ClonePageParameters</code> to false when cloning through the API.</p>


<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#optimize-image-assets">manually optimizing</a> an image, the system now shows a more accurate approximate file size of the image after adjustments.</li>
<li>The image preview displayed while optimizing an image now better reflects the chosen image format and quality.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Pages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pages scheduled to be <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#unpublish-pages">unpublished</a> can no longer be selected as a <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#redirects-from-unpublished-and-deleted-pages">redirect</a> target to prevent circular redirects.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Xperience Portal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users can now <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#reset-multi-factor-authentication">reset their Multi-Factor Authentication configuration</a> if they cannot access the device or account used for MFA.</li>
<li>The primary contact of a project is now highlighted in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#users">Users</a> listing.</li>

<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<p>With the introduction of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder">Email Builder</a>, the following interfaces that allow developers to work with <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> component properties were made obsolete and replaced:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Kentico.PageBuilder.Web.Mvc.IComponentProperties</code>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>IComponentProperties</code> from the <code>Kentico.Builder.Web.Mvc</code> namespace instead (shared for all visual builder component properties).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>IComponentPropertiesRetriever</code>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>IPageBuilderComponentPropertiesRetriever</code> instead (both interfaces are found in the <code>Kentico.PageBuilder.Web.Mvc</code> namespace).</li>

<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>API – Using the <code>IRowActionListingConfiguration.AddEditRowAction</code> extension method multiple times with the same <code>parameters</code> argument could lead to an unexpected exception.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>The admin UI could become unresponsive when attempting to navigate to another application in the left navigation menu while multiple right side panel editing dialogs were open over each other.</li>
<li>The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces">workspace</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">language</a> selectors in the <em>Content hub</em> application did not highlight the currently selected items in the drop-down. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact management</p>
<ul>
<li>If a very large number (over 100 000) was entered into the “in the last x days” parameter of a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact group</a> or <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation</a> condition, an error occurred. After applying the fix, the condition evaluates as if the parameter were empty in these cases.</li>
<li>The links displayed for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management">consents</a> in a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contact’s</a> profile within the <em>Contact management</em> application didn’t work. After applying the fix, the links open the editing UI for the related consent.</li>
<li>The list of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management">consents</a> in a contact’s profile within the <em>Contact management</em> application incorrectly displayed consents even after they were revoked. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Former URLs – <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#unpublish-pages">Unpublishing</a> or <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/delete-pages">deleting</a> a page that was previously moved in the content tree and then moved back to the original location lead to circular redirects.</p></li>
<li><p>General – Unused vulnerable dependency packages were removed from the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder">Form Builder</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Page permissions – Duplicate records could be created in the <em>CMS_WebPageAcl</em> table during a project’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects">update</a> if the updated project’s database was in an inconsistent state (e.g., caused by a previously failed update where the database wasn’t restored to its original state using a backup). This refresh prevents future duplicate records from occurring and removes existing ones. Pages that had their duplicate <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/page-permission-management">page permissions</a> removed in this way can be found in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/event-log">event log</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance – Queries executed during the initialization of the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">Content hub</a> listing were optimized to improve performance.</p></li>

<section id="new-features-5" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Redirects for deleted and unpublished pages</strong><br>
When <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#unpublish-pages">unpublishing</a> or <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/delete-pages">deleting</a> a page, editors can create a <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#redirects-from-unpublished-and-deleted-pages">redirect</a> to another page. This can be used to ensure that visitors land on an alternative page and don’t get a 404 error. Redirects are listed and can be edited in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls">Former URLs</a> application.</p>
<p>Permissions for Former URLs now include the <em>Update</em> permission, which allows changing redirect targets from unpublished and deleted pages.</p>


<p><strong>Rate limiting</strong><br>
All endpoints used as part of the Xperience administration <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">user management</a> functionality, such as the sign-in or registration page, are now protected by rate limiting. This restricts the number of requests allowed within a given window of time, which provides additional security against brute-force attacks. Rate limiting is implemented using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/rate-limit" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core Rate limiting middleware</a>.</p>
<p>To learn about the default rate limiting policy and its configuration options, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/administration-registration-and-authentication/administration-forms-authentication#rate-limiting-for-user-management-endpoints">Rate limiting for user management endpoints</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, developers can <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/security-guidelines/rate-limiting">set up rate limiting</a> for other endpoints, based on your project’s requirements and traffic load.</p>


<p><strong>Retrieval of content from workspaces</strong><br>
Content item queries now support the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query#inworkspaces">InWorkspaces</a> method for parameterizing data retrieval. This method allows developers to retrieve content items from specific <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces">workspaces</a>, providing a consistent content experience across channels and workspaces.</p>


<p><strong>‘Set contact field value’ step for automation</strong><br>
A new step type is available for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation</a>, which allows users to set a value for the selected contact field using an automation process.</p>


<p><strong>Refresh button for automation statistics</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation#automation-process-analytics">statistics of an automation process</a> can now be refreshed on demand using the Refresh button.</p>


<p><strong>Restart applications in the SaaS environment</strong><br>
If users cannot access a deployed Xperience application, they can <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments#restart-deployed-applications">restart the application</a> directly in Xperience Portal.</p>


<p><strong>Manual licensing synchronization</strong><br>
Users can now manually synchronize an Xperience instance with the Kentico license server via a new <em>Synchronize</em> button located under <em>Settings</em> -&gt; <em>System</em> -&gt; <em>License</em>. For example, this can be useful if you want to quickly recover from an accidental license violation.</p>

</section>
<section id="updates-and-changes-5" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p><strong>Dynamic column width in object listing tables</strong><br>
All listing tables in the administration now scale the width of columns according to the space required for the displayed values. This allows the listings to use the available space more efficiently, avoids unnecessary scrolling, and makes it easier to read long values in most cases.</p>


<p><strong>Asynchronous Set and Delete methods for InfoProvider API</strong><br>
The system’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api">InfoProvider API</a> now supports asynchronously saving data to and deleting data from the database via the <code>SetAsync</code> and <code>DeleteAsync</code> methods.</p>


<p><strong>New analyzer to assist with Xperience project development</strong><br>
The <em>Kentico.Xperience.Core</em> NuGet package now ships with an analyzer that provides a set of rules to advocate certain best practices when developing Xperience by Kentico projects. The initial version of the analyzer informs the developer about the need to override the asynchronous counterpart of a synchronous method (or vice versa) if their custom type overrides one of the <code>InfoProviderDecorator&lt;TInfo&gt;</code> or <code>AbstractInfoBase&lt;TInfo&gt;</code> methods related to data modification.</p>


<p><strong>Hot Chocolate update</strong><br>
The <em>Hot Chocolate</em> GraphQL server used for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management">headless channels</a> was updated to <a href="https://chillicream.com/blog/2024/08/30/hot-chocolate-14" target="_blank">version 14</a>. If you directly use <code>HotChocolate</code> packages in your project, make sure to <a href="https://github.com/ChilliCream/graphql-platform/blob/720cb959b5fd19d7782c755e2799312b30479f96/website/src/docs/hotchocolate/v14/migrating/migrate-from-13-to-14.md" target="_blank">update your code</a> accordingly.</p>


<p><strong>Interfaces for form contexts</strong><br>
The following interfaces for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components#form-component-back-end">admin UI</a> form contexts were made public:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>IMultilingualFormContext</code></li>
<li><code>IWorkspaceFormContext</code></li>
<li><code>IContentItemFormContextBase</code></li>
<li><code>IContentItemFormContext</code></li>
<li><code>IWebPageFormContext</code></li>
<li><code>IEmailItemFormContext</code></li>
<li><code>IHeadlessItemFormContext</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s now possible to determine in which context the admin UI form component is used. Form context instances can be created using the following new factories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>IContentItemFormContextFactory</code></li>
<li><code>IWebPageFormContextFactory</code></li>
<li><code>IEmailItemFormContextFactory</code></li>
<li><code>IHeadlessItemFormContextFactory</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Continuous Deployment restore mode performance improvements</strong><br>
Continuous Deployment was updated to more quickly <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories#configure-cd-restore-mode">restore</a> the serialized repository on the target machine. The most significant performance increase was recorded when using the <code>Create</code> mode. Larger speedup was also observed with the <code>CreateUpdate</code> and <code>Full</code> restore modes.</p>

<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>After changing the display name of a workspace in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces">Workspaces</a> application, the system displayed an incorrect message in the dialog notifying about the change of the code name.</li>
<li>Header action buttons on editing pages in the administration incorrectly remained active while another action was being processed after being selected. On slower connections, this allowed users to select multiple actions concurrently, for example <em>Save</em> a new object while its creation was being cancelled.</li>
<li>If there were unsaved changes in a side panel editing dialog, selecting another action within the main page that opened another side panel dialog could cause the UI to become unresponsive. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Assets – When <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#optimize-image-assets">manually optimizing</a> an image for the first time, the system didn’t correctly display the image preview if you changed the image format multiple times in a row without saving the content item.</p></li>
<li><p>Automation – When a condition in the <em>Condition</em> step of an <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation process</a> was replaced, the new condition was applied but an error was logged by the system’s event log.</p></li>
<li><p>Content hub – The <em>Delete</em> button in the confirmation dialog for the <em>Delete</em> action for <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">content items</a> remained active after being selected, which could allow users on slow connections to start multiple concurrent delete actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Emails – Visiting the <em>Preview</em> tab of an <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">email</a> with links in its content resulted in an error being logged in the browser console.</p></li>
<li><p>Former URLs – When an <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#unpublish-pages">unpublished</a> page with a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">fallback language variant</a> was moved in the content tree or its slug was changed, the corresponding <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls#former-urls">former URL</a> was not created.</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – Repeatedly calling the <code>IWebPageDataContextRetriever</code> used for retrieving page data of the current page could lead to an error. The issue occurred when working with pages in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance when loading page data in the <em>Content</em> view mode in website channel applications.</li>
<li>The initial data load of the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">Content hub</a> listing was optimized to improve performance. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Permissions – <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management#assign-permissions-to-roles">Changing permissions</a> for a given application and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces">workspace</a> caused the application’s permission GUIDs in the database to regenerate causing unnecessary changes in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">CI/CD</a> data representing the permission configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>UI form components – When creating a new content item via the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#combined-content-selector">Combined content selector</a> UI form component, any visibility conditions assigned to the fields of the item’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content type</a> were not evaluated and applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Xperience Portal – Warnings and errors in the <em>Event log</em> and <em>Exceptions</em> applications in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal">Xperience Portal</a> were incorrectly filtered. The applications now contain all available entries.</p></li>

<h3>.NET 9 support</h3>

<p>Xperience by Kentico supports application development using .NET 9, the latest major .NET framework release. For more information on .NET 9, see Microsoft’s <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-9/" target="_blank">official announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The support also includes Kentico’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage">SaaS</a> solution, which supports the deployment of projects based on .NET 9.</p>
<p><strong>Known issues</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0?view=aspnetcore-9.0#static-asset-delivery-optimization" target="_blank">MapStaticAssets</a> feature is currently not supported. Adding the middleware to your application pipeline prevents <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder">Form Builder</a> from working. As a workaround, use the existing <code>UseStaticFiles</code> middleware.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Support for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0?view=aspnetcore-9.0#static-asset-delivery-optimization" target="_blank">MapStaticAssets</a> feature was introduced in <a href="#hotfix-january-9-2025">hotfix 30.0.2</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="new-features-6" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Workspaces</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">Content hub</a> application is now scoped under <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces">workspaces</a>. Workspaces allow you to organize your content into multiple distinct manageable units, making content easier to manage and maintain. You can <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management#assign-permissions-to-roles">assign roles with permissions</a> to these units to restrict or grant access to specific content based on user roles or responsibilities, enhancing collaboration by allowing teams to segregate their work and control who can view or edit certain content. Additionally, this approach mitigates security risks by ensuring that sensitive content is only accessible to authorized users, reducing the risk of data breaches or misuse.</p>
<p>Projects updated to version 30.0.0 and newer have all their Content hub content stored in a <em>Default workspace</em>. The roles with permissions for the Content hub application have the same permissions for Content hub in the <em>Default workspace</em>. For more information see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces#default-workspace">Default workspace</a>.</p>
<p>The release of this feature introduces changes to related CI/CD objects. See <a href="#CiCdObjects30">New object types for CI/CD</a> for possible manual steps depending on your project and repository configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Known issues</strong>: When updating from an older version to version 30.0.0 or higher, default data, such as the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces#default-workspace">default workspace</a>, is created. This happens separately for each application environment (QA, production, etc.). If you update a local instance, delete any of this default data, and then use <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> to transfer the object changes to another environment, the default data will not be removed (unless you use CD with <code>Full</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories#configure-cd-restore-mode">restore mode</a>). For example, the issue can occur when deploying to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/saas-overview">SaaS</a> environments. If you wish to remove this default data, you need to do so manually in all your environments.</p>


<p><strong>Scheduled tasks</strong><br>
Users can now define and manage <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/scheduled-tasks">scheduled tasks</a> via the new Scheduled tasks application. Scheduled tasks automate recurring operations by defining tasks that execute at specified intervals. The feature supports task configuration, scheduling, and execution, enabling task-based automation with customizable intervals, logging, and error handling.</p>
<p>Developers can implement tasks by creating classes that implement the <code>IScheduledTask</code> interface and registering them under a unique identifier. In the Scheduled tasks application, they can then define task intervals, enable or disable tasks, and monitor results via the application’s <em>Last result</em> column.</p>
<p>In previous versions, the system relied on scheduled tasks internally. The release of this feature introduces changes to related CI/CD objects. See <a href="#CiCdObjects30">New object types for CI/CD</a> for possible manual steps depending on your project and repository configuration.</p>


<p><strong>Visibility conditions for content type fields</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">field editor</a> for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schemas</a> was extended to support visibility conditions. These conditions allow users to set up fields that are dynamically displayed or hidden, for example based on the value of another field. By default, the system provides a set of field evaluation conditions, and developers can create and register <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-visibility-conditions">custom visibility conditions</a> to meet specific project requirements.</p>


<p><strong>Dimensions in asset metadata</strong><br>
<code>ContentItemAssetMetadata</code> was extended with new properties representing the <code>Width</code> and <code>Height</code> of the asset in pixels. The system currently supports calculating the properties only for image assets (the value is automatically <code>null</code> for all other asset types). You can access these properties when <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-content-items#retrieve-assets">retrieving assets</a> or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-headless-content#basic-querying">querying the GraphQL schema</a> and use them, e.g., to prevent layout shifts when displaying content on the web.</p>
<p>The system automatically calculates the dimensions for new images. To calculate the dimensions for all images already in the system after applying the update, run the <em>Calculate dimensions</em> of image assets <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/scheduled-tasks">scheduled task</a>. After the task successfully completes, you can safely delete it.</p>


<p><strong>Image optimization</strong><br>
You can now <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#optimize-image-assets">optimize image assets</a> for their use across different channels by converting the images to a more suitable format and adjusting their quality. To help ensure that editors use optimized images, administrators can <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types#automatically-optimize-image-assets">configure automatic optimization</a> upon image creation in the system.</p>
<p>To optimize any image already present in the system, <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">reupload</a> it (if automatic optimization is configured) or optimize the image manually.</p>


<p><strong>Support for SVG and AVIF image formats</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">Content item assets</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/media-libraries/manage-media-files">media libraries</a> now support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG" target="_blank">SVG</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF" target="_blank">AVIF</a> formats for image files. Such images can be uploaded in the administration, selected in various image selectors, and displayed to your audience through channels.</p>
<p>After updating existing projects, the image extensions that you wish to use must be added manually in the <em>Settings → Content → Assets → Asset allowed extensions</em> setting.</p>
<p>SVG images are not allowed by default, because they may host scripts or CSS that can pose a security risk. Carefully consider the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/content-hub-configuration#support-for-svg-images">potential security impacts</a> before allowing the SVG file type.</p>


<p><strong>Custom activity support for automation</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">Automation</a> now supports a new <em>Custom activity</em> trigger type, which allows you to set up more flexible automation processes. Additionally, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities/custom-activities">custom activities</a> can be logged by a step within an automation process, which can then trigger another process.</p>


<p><strong>‘Contact field is empty’ condition for contact groups and automation</strong><br>
A new condition is available for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact groups</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a>, which allows marketers to check if a contact field contains a value or not. Developers can set up the empty values for custom data types.</p>


<p><strong>‘Contact field has value’ condition for automation</strong><br>
The <em>Contact field is empty</em> condition, previously only available in <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact groups</a>, can now also be used in <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Improved App Service plans of QA/UAT SaaS environments</strong><br>
The <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/windows/" target="_blank">App Service plans</a> for <em>QA</em> and <em>UAT</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-application-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deployment environments</a> were upgraded from <em>S1</em> to <em>P0V3</em> to improve performance.</p>


<p><strong>Xperience Portal improvements</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal">Xperience Portal</a> was improved in several locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xperience Portal users can now <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments#alerts">customize</a> the types of alerts they want to receive for each environment.</li>
<li>A new <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments#email-metrics">Email metrics</a> application allows Xperience Portal users to monitor email statistics from the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration#sendgrid-integration">SendGrid platform</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Advanced rich text editor customization</strong><br>
New <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/rich-text-editor-configuration/rich-text-editor-customization">rich text editor customization</a> options that allow developers to control how the system loads rich text editor configurations and to make dynamic adjustments of the configuration. For example, this approach can be used to insert custom CSS into the rich text editor.</p>


<p><strong>Language flags</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">Languages</a> were extended with a flag icon selector, enabling you to set a flag icon visually representing a language. Languages with a flag icon set have their flags displayed in the <em>Language</em> column in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/content-hub-configuration">Content hub</a> , corresponding to the languages a content item is translated into.</p>


<p><strong>Clone pages</strong><br>
An option to <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/create-pages#clone-a-page">clone</a> existing pages was added. This new option allows users to quickly create new pages with the same web page data.</p>


<p><strong>Configurable Content hub listing</strong><br>
Content Hub now supports <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub#configure-content-hub-listing">listing configuration</a>, allowing users to customize the order of columns and select which columns are displayed. This configuration is client-side only and will not affect other users.</p>


<p><strong>New object code name selector attribute</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#object-selector">object code name selector</a> UI form component now has an <code>ObjectCodeNameSelectorComponent</code> attribute, which allows developers to use the selector as an <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/editing-components">editing component</a>.</p>

<section id="updates-and-changes-6" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p><strong>.NET 8 is now the minimum supported .NET framework version</strong><br>
Xperience by Kentico now requires <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0" target="_blank">.NET 8</a> as the minimum framework version. Projects that update to version 30.0.0 or newer must target .NET 8 or <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0" target="_blank">.NET 9</a>. The support for .NET 6 is being deprecated in alignment with Microsoft’s planned end-of-life for the version.</p>
<p>With this transition, support for binary serialization was removed from the system. This change primarily impacts all <em>Info</em> classes. The removed API includes the <code>GetObjectData</code> method, the <code>ISerializable</code> interface, and the serialization constructor of each Info class: <code>protected (SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) : base(info, context)</code>. Additionally, assertions related to binary serialization testing were removed from the testing framework provided via the <em>Kentico.Xperience.Core.Tests</em> NuGet package. These changes reflect Microsoft’s indirect <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/serialization/8.0/binaryformatter-disabled" target="_blank">removal of BinaryFormatter</a> from the framework.</p>


<p><strong>Code generator – Change to the default behavior of provider class generation</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects">code generator</a> no longer creates provider classes (<em>InfoProvider</em>) and interfaces (<em>IInfoProvider</em>) by default when generating object type classes (<code>--type Classes</code>). To include these, you must use the <code>--with-provider-class parameter</code>. This change aligns projects with our recommendation to use the <code>IInfoProvider&lt;TInfo&gt;</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api#generic-provider-class-iinfoprovidertinfo">API</a> as a generic substitute for per-Info provider classes.</p>
<p>For additional details on this and other parameters, refer to the documentation or use the <code>--help</code> option in the code generator.</p>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For existing projects</strong> – Review and update any existing scripts or processes in your development pipeline that rely on the automatic generation of provider classes and interfaces. Add the <code>--with-provider-class True</code> parameter where needed.</li>
<li>
<strong>For new projects</strong> – Use <code>IInfoProvider&lt;TInfo&gt;</code> where possible for cleaner and more maintainable code. Use explicit providers only when required.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>BizFormFiles moved under assets</strong><br>
The <em>BizFormFiles</em> folder stores files uploaded via <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">form</a> fields using the <em>Upload file</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/reference-form-builder-components">form component</a>. For new projects installed with version 30.0.0 or newer, this folder is placed under the <em>~/assets</em> folder instead of the project root.</p>
<p>Applying the update to existing projects does not immediately move the folder, and the system maintains full backward compatibility for the original location. However, we strongly recommend moving the folder to the new location via the following steps after you update your project:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Verify whether your project or any related infrastructure relies on the original <em>~/BizFormFiles</em> path. Prepare any necessary adjustments to reflect the new <em>~/assets/BizFormFiles</em> path.</li>
<li>Manually execute the <em>Move BizFormFiles to the assets folder</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/scheduled-tasks">scheduled task</a>.
<ul>
<li>This task is added to your project as part of the update</li>
<li>When executed, the task moves all <em>BizFormFiles</em> content under <em>~/assets/BizFormFiles</em>, and then deletes the original folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apply any required changes from step 1.</li>
<li>Remove any <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers">file system mapping</a> of the <em>~/BizFormFiles</em> folder to shared storage, such as <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage">Azure Blob storage</a> or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/amazon-s3">Amazon S3</a>.
<ul>
<li>Typically, your project will already contain mappings of the entire <em>~/assets</em> folder, so you will not need to add new mappings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Database changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The following columns in the <code>CMS_ContentItemCommonData</code> database table were renamed:
<ul>
<li>ContentItemCommonDataPageBuilderWidgets → ContentItemCommonDataVisualBuilderWidgets</li>
<li>ContentItemCommonDataPageTemplateConfiguration → ContentItemCommonDataVisualBuilderTemplateConfiguration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>Temp_PageBuilderWidgets</code> table was renamed to <code>Temp_VisualBuilderWidgets</code>, including all columns.</li>
<li>The following columns were removed from the <code>CMS_WorkflowAction</code> table:
<ul>
<li>ActionParameters</li>
<li>ActionResourceID</li>
<li>ActionIconClass</li>
<li>ActionThumbnailClass</li>
<li>ActionDataProviderClass</li>
<li>ActionDataProviderAssemblyName</li>
<li>ActionAllowedObjects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes may break any custom database queries, scripts, or procedures that use the original names.</p>


<p><strong>Change to the default behavior of CMSBuilderScriptsIncludeJQuery</strong><br>
The <code>CMSBuilderScriptsIncludeJQuery</code> setting introduced in version 29.6.0 now defaults to <code>false</code>. Users need to explicitly opt-in for jQuery usage by enabling the setting via application configuration (<em>appsettings.json</em>). See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/bundle-static-assets-of-builder-components#link-jquery-as-part-of-builder-scripts">Link jQuery as part of builder scripts</a>.</p>
<p>With this change, jQuery is considered deprecated and will be phased out completely in one of the future major releases. The library will not be updated from the current 3.5.1 version, even in the case of new vulnerability disclosures. Projects with custom components that rely on the library should consider referencing an external implementation to prevent possible issues in the future.</p>


<p><strong>Multi-factor authentication system page URLs</strong><br>
The following system page URLs used by the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management#multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> feature were updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>/admin/mfa-recovery-code → /admin/mfa/recovery-code</li>
<li>/admin/mfa-logon-recovery → /admin/mfa/logon-recovery</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CI/CD ObjectIdentificationFields settings key</strong><br>
<code>ObjectIdentificationFields</code> is a new <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types/object-type-configuration/enable-ci-cd-for-object-types#continuousintegrationsettings">CI/CD settings key</a> used for object identification in a database when the <code>CodeNameColumn</code> is not available. The key was introduced to prevent duplicate records of objects without a code name column (e.g., permissions set in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">Role management</a>).</p>


<p><strong>Generate URLs to Content hub pages</strong><br>
With the Content hub now being scoped under <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces">workspaces</a>, the URL structure in the <em>Content hub</em> has been updated to include the <code>WorkspaceID</code>. When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages#generate-urls-to-other-administration-pages">generating URLs</a> to <em>Content hub</em> pages, make sure to specify the <code>WorkspaceID</code> in the <code>IPageLinkGenerator</code> URL parameters to avoid incorrect URLs. The <code>WorkspaceID</code> is retrieved from workspace-scoped items, for example, content items, content folders, or smart folders.</p>

<section id="new-object-types-for-cicd-3" data-section="" data-section-ci-cd="">
<h3>New object types for CI/CD</h3>

<p><span id="CiCdObjects30"></span></p>
<p>The update introduces the following object types, which are supported by the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> features. Consider updating the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories">repository.config</a> files of your CI/CD repositories, particularly when using the <code>&lt;IncludedObjectTypes&gt;</code> allowlist for object type filtering.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>cms.scheduledtaskconfiguration</code> – stores scheduled task configurations from the <em>Scheduled</em> tasks application.
<ul>
<li>This new object type automatically replaces the existing <code>cms.scheduledtask</code> object type (used internally by the system in previous versions) when serializing the repository for the first time after the update.</li>
<li>If you have <code>cms.scheduledtask</code> included in your <em>repository.config</em> file, you <strong>must</strong> remove it before serializing the repository for the first time after completing the update. This primarily concerns SaaS projects as they are required to maintain an explicit allowlist of all object types in <em>repository.config</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>cms.workspace</code> – stores workspaces
<ul>
<li>In case you have Content hubs objects included in your <em>repository.config</em> file, you <strong>must</strong> add this object type to your file’s allowlist for the serialization of the repository to not fail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>cms.workspacedatapermission</code> – stores the workspace permission name, application identifier, workspace identifier, and role identifier.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Breaking changes – API</h3>

<p><strong>VersionStatus and ContentItemVersionStatus ‘Archived’ value now produces a compilation error</strong><br>
The obsolete <code>VersionStatus.Archived</code> and <code>ContentItemVersionStatus.Archived</code> enum values now produce a compilation <em>error</em>. This change ensures developers transition to the recommended <code>Unpublished</code> value. To restore project compatibility, replace all instances of <code>Archived</code> from the corresponding enum with <code>Unpublished</code>.</p>

</section>
<section id="newly-obsolete-api-4" data-section="" data-section-obsolete="">
<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<p><strong>Generic provider updates</strong><br>
The following Info providers were made obsolete. Use the generic <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api#generic-provider-class-iinfoprovidertinfo">IInfoProvider</a> provider instead.</p>
<p><em>CMS.DataProtection</em> namespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>ConsentInfoProvider</li>
<li>ConsentAgreementInfoProvider</li>
<li>ConsentArchiveInfoProvider</li>
</ul>
<p><em>CMS.Modules</em> namespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>ResourceInfoProvider</li>

<p><em>CMS.ContactManagement</em> namespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>ContactInfoProvider</li>
<li>ContactGroupInfoProvider</li>
<li>ContactGroupMemberInfoProvider</li>
<li>ContactRoleInfoProvider</li>
<li>ContactStatusInfoProvider</li>

<li>AccountInfoProvider</li>
<li>AccountStatusInfoProvider</li>
</ul>
<p><em>CMS.ContentEngine</em> namespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>ContentFolderInfoProvider</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ContactInfoProvider methods</strong><br>
The <code>ContactInfoProvider</code> class for managing <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contacts</a> is obsolete, and basic CRUD operations can instead be performed via the generic <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api#generic-provider-class-iinfoprovidertinfo">IInfoProvider</a> provider. Methods that provided functionality outside of this scope were refactored into separate supporting services, and have the following replacements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>GetContactInfo(string email)</em> → <em>IContactExternalDataUpdateService.GetByEmail</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>UpdateContactFromExternalData</em> → <em>IContactExternalDataUpdateService.Update</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>DeleteContactInfos</em> → <em>IContactsDeleteService.BulkDelete</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>GetContactFullName</em> → <em>ContactInfo.ContactDescriptiveName</em> property</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Content item parameter API</strong><br>
All the <code>CreateContentItemParametersconstructors</code> for creating content item parameters were made obsolete. Use the new <code>CreateContentItemParameters</code> constructor with 5 parameters instead, which additionally specifies a content item’s workspace.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Content folder API</strong><br>
The <code>GetRoot</code> and <code>GetRootAsync</code> methods for retrieving the root content folder in Content hub were made obsolete. Use the new <code>GetRoot</code> and <code>GetRootAsync</code> methods with a <code>workspaceName</code> parameter for retrieving the root content folder from a specific workspace instead.</p>
<p><strong>Admin UI customization API</strong><br>
The <code>UINoPermissionRequired</code> attribute, which indicated permissionless access to and visibility of applications in the admin UI, was made obsolete and renamed <code>NoPermissionRequired</code>, which has identical functionality.</p>

<h3>Removed obsolete API</h3>

<p>The refresh release removes API marked <em>Obsolete</em> since version 27.0.0. Ensure your code no longer references these members to avoid compilation errors.</p>
<p>The following list highlights important types and areas of the API that were affected.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>CMSString</code> wrapper class over the framework <code>string</code> object – use conventional framework APIs to work with strings instead.</p></li>
<li><p><code>TypeHelper</code> helper methods for manipulating object type code name strings – there is no alternative.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SqlHelper</code> methods for query manipulation and comparison were made internal – there is no alternative.</p></li>

<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin UI – Values entered into <em>Code name</em> inputs weren’t validated correctly for the maximum allowed length in certain parts of the system (e.g., content folder code names).</li>
<li>Segments in the content folder breadcrumb navigation shown in the <em>Combined content selector</em> dialog didn’t work correctly with all link operations provided by browsers.</li>
<li>The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types#add-option-to-upload-files">Asset uploader</a> form component incorrectly displayed the previous version of an image after a new image was uploaded. The public content was not affected and the correct image was displayed. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Admin UI customization – It wasn’t possible to disable the <em>Role</em> selection field for the editing form in the <em>Users</em> application via the <em>Edit</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types/extend-system-object-types">UI form</a> of the customizable <em>User</em> class.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Automation</p>
<ul>
<li>Users without the <em>Update</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">permission</a> for the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">Automation</a> application were not able to view the contents of the General panel, receiving an <em>Access denied</em> notification.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation#automation-process-analytics">Automation process statistics</a> did not display time zone information in the <em>Statistics from</em> tooltip. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Content hub – Saving an update of the <em>Requires authentication</em> property for a <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">content item</a> didn’t trigger an update of the item’s <em>Last modified</em> date and time.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Emails</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">email</a> preview displayed an error if more than 5 levels of <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#link-content-items">linked content items</a> were added to the email’s fields. After applying the update, the error no longer appears, but the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types#add-the-option-to-link-content-items">limit of 5 nested content item levels</a> still applies, and further levels are not loaded into the email content.</li>
<li>Users without the <em>Send email</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">permission</a> for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management">email channel</a> applications were incorrectly able to edit <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">regular emails</a> that were scheduled to be sent. This permission is now required. After applying the update, add the <em>Send email</em> permission to all <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">roles</a> that need to be able to edit scheduled regular emails. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Object types – When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types/object-type-configuration/model-object-type-relationships">modeling object type relationships</a> via a database column in a custom module class, the <em>Reference to</em> selector offered a large number of object types that were not relevant (such as binding object types or internal system objects).</p></li>
<li><p>Permissions – Users could see sections of a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a>’s content tree without having the <em>Display</em> permission set for the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/page-permission-management#allow-users-to-work-with-website-channel-content">website’s root</a>. Only sections <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/page-permission-management#edit-page-permissions">breaking inheritance</a> and having at least the <em>Display</em> permission were visible. The final fix for this issue is introduced in <a href="#refresh-december-12-2024">Refresh 30.3.0</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Users – The <em>Users</em> application incorrectly allowed the <em>User name</em> value to be edited for inactive <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">users</a> who hadn’t accepted the invitation yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Website content – It was not possible to create a new <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/translate-pages">language variant</a> of a page using the <em>Copy content from another language</em> option if the current language variant of the page contained an empty field with the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types#add-option-to-upload-files">Asset uploader</a> form component.</p></li>

<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Combined content selector</strong><br>
The content item selector <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">form component</a> was improved to enable the selection of web pages from <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">content trees of website channels</a> in addition to reusable content items from the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">content hub</a>. As a result, the selector was renamed to <em>Combined content selector</em>. This improvement enables developers to directly access fields of selected web pages in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-templates#linked-pages-and-content-items">emails</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-headless-content#linked-pages">headless content</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Administration authentication improvements</strong><br>
The authentication functionality of the Xperience administration now provides the following features, which help increase security against brute-force attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account lockout – temporarily blocks authentication for user accounts after a number of failed sign-in attempts. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management#account-lockout">Account lockout</a> to learn more.</li>
<li>Forbidden passwords – allows developers to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/administration-registration-and-authentication/administration-forms-authentication#password-options">configure a list of passwords</a> that cannot be submitted when users register new accounts or reset existing passwords (even if the password otherwise fulfills password policy requirements). This prevents users from choosing common or easy-to-guess passwords.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Notifications for administration users</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/notifications">Notifications</a> inform users of the administration about various events. In the current release, notifications are supported for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">user management</a> events, such as <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management#reset-password">invitations</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management#invite-users">password resets</a>. These notifications replace the original code-driven approach to customizing user management emails, which allows non-developers to adjust the notification content directly in the administration through the new <em>Notifications</em> application.</p>


<p><strong>Asset download</strong><br>
The <em>Content hub</em> application now allows editors to <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#download-files">download files</a> uploaded as content item assets.</p>


<p><strong>Automation summary for contacts</strong><br>
When viewing contacts in the <em>Contact management</em> application, the new <em>Automation processes</em> tab displays a list of <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a> the contact has triggered and the current step for each process. Additionally, the three latest automation processes of a contact are displayed on the <em>Overview</em> tab.</p>


<p><strong>Run database migrations during CI/CD restore</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd">CI/CD</a> utility now supports running <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/ci-cd-database-migration-scripts">database migrations</a> as part of the CI/CD database restore operation via the <code>--enable-migrations</code> parameter. When using this parameter, migrations don’t need to be applied using external scripts. The utility now covers all CI/CD scenarios supported by Xperience.</p>

<h3>Updates and changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Automation – The <em>Backspace</em>, <em>Shift</em> and <em>Space</em> keys no longer have any effect in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">Automation Builder</a> interface. Previously, these keys could cause unintentional interactions while designing automation processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Form components – The <em>Content item selector</em> form component was renamed to <em>Combined content selector</em>, and the related <em>Content items</em> data type was renamed to <em>Pages and reusable content</em>. These changes only affect the administration interface. The code representation of the affected object remains the same. The form component attribute for the Combined content selector is still <code>ContentItemSelectorComponent</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Forms – The UI for configuring basic autoresponders and more advanced email automation for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms">forms</a> was split into two separate tabs in the form options panel (<em>Autoresponder</em> and <em>Automation</em>).</p></li>

<section id="new-object-types-for-cicd-4" data-section="" data-section-ci-cd="">
<h3>New object types for CI/CD</h3>

<p>The update introduces the following object types, which are supported by the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> features. Consider updating the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories">repository.config</a> files of your CI/CD repositories, particularly when using the <code>&lt;IncludedObjectTypes&gt;</code> allowlist for object type filtering.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>cms.notificationemail</code> – stores the content and configuration of system notification emails (user invitations, password reset emails, etc.).</li>
<li>
<code>cms.notificationemailtemplate</code> – stores notification email templates.</li>
</ul>

<section id="newly-obsolete-api-5" data-section="" data-section-obsolete="">
<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<p><strong>Generic provider updates</strong></p>
<p>The <code>ApplicationPermissionInfoProvider</code> class from the <em>CMS.Membership</em> namespaces was made obsolete. Use the generic <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api#generic-provider-class-iinfoprovidertinfo">IInfoProvider</a> provider instead.</p>
<p><strong>Options API for administration authentication emails</strong></p>
<p>The following options API related to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">user management</a> emails was made obsolete:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AdminIdentityEmailOptions.SenderAddress</code></li>
<li><code>AdminIdentityEmailOptions.RegistrationEmailMessageProvider</code></li>
<li><code>AdminIdentityEmailOptions.ResetPasswordEmailMessageProvider</code></li>
<li><code>AdminIdentityEmailOptions.ResetMultifactorSecretKeyEmailMessageProvider</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, customize user management emails via the corresponding <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/notifications">notifications</a>, which can be configured through the new <em>Notifications</em> application in the administration UI.</p>
<p>If you have the obsolete <code>AdminIdentityEmailOptions.SenderAddress</code> property configured, it overrides sender addresses configured in the <em>Notifications</em> application. We recommend that you set the sender address for each notification email through the <em>Notifications</em> application, and then remove the usage of the obsolete API.</p>
<p><strong>ContactInfoProvider methods</strong></p>
<p>The following <code>ContactInfoProvider</code> methods are now obsolete:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GetContactIDByEmail(string email)</code> – use the <em>GetContactInfo(string email)</em> method instead.</li>
<li>
<code>GetContactFullName(int id)</code> – use the overload with a <em>ContactInfo</em> parameter instead.</li>
<li>
<code>UpdateContactFromExternalData(BaseInfo source, bool allowOverwrite, int contactID)</code> – use the overload with a <em>ContactInfo</em> parameter instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>The UI of the <em>Content hub</em> application didn’t work correctly if content items were deleted while being selected in the listing. The number of selected items wasn’t updated and the mass actions for selected remained visible even if all of the selected items were deleted.</li>
<li>When the <em>From/To</em> option in a listing filter was filled in, the resulting time range was calculated incorrectly (depending on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset" target="_blank">UTC offset</a> of the server hosting the application). Applying the filter could then cause the listing to display the wrong results. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Auto-scaling – The system’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/auto-scaling-support">auto-scaling support</a> didn’t correctly synchronize <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">role-permission assignments</a> to other instances of the application (for example when an application permission was removed for a role or a role was deleted).</p></li>
<li><p>Automation – <em>Wait</em> steps within <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a> incorrectly allowed users to enter a time interval value lower than 1.</p></li>
<li><p>CI/CD – Trying to create a different <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/translate-pages">language variant</a> of a website channel page after a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd">CI/CD</a> restore operation could lead to an error. This issue occurred if the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">language</a> of the variant was newly added by the CI/CD restore, and only for pages that didn’t exist on the source instance of the CI/CD data.</p></li>
<li><p>Caching – Cached content of web pages was not cleared when the web page data of linked pages (e.g., URL slug) was modified.</p></li>
<li><p>Cookies – Signing in to the administration interface didn’t increase the accepted <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/cookies#cookie-levels">cookie level</a> to <em>Editor</em> in the user’s browser. This could cause issues in the administration of projects that used custom cookies registered with the <em>Editor</em> level.</p></li>
<li><p>Event log – In certain cases, database exceptions related to event logging could occur when running code making use of <code>CMS.DataEngine.ApplicationBackgroundService</code>. For example, background system tasks and custom code were affected. The issue was caused by logging dynamic-length values to database columns limited to 100 characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Headless content – The GraphQL schema of a headless channel couldn’t be <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-headless-content">queried</a> when a <a href="/documentation/business-users/headless-content">headless content type</a> referenced other headless types via a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schema</a> that wasn’t used by any headless content types assigned to the channel.</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a>’s editing UI stopped working correctly if left open for an hour without a refresh, which could cause all unsaved changes to be lost. The issue occurred on version 29.5.0 or newer.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Rich text editor</p>
<ul>
<li>Pasting formatted text into the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a> could result in invalid <em>HTML</em> caused by multiple identical <em>id</em> attributes.</li>
<li>When editing the content of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a> pages, URLs containing the given website channel’s domain inserted into the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a> were processed incorrectly. Such URLs could then point to the wrong domain in cases where the website channel’s domain was different than the domain used to access the administration application. </li>

</section>
<section id="new-features-8" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Multi-factor authentication for the administration</strong><br>
The Xperience administration now supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">users</a>. You can enable MFA to add an extra layer of security to the administration sign-in process – users need to provide a passcode generated by an authenticator app using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password" target="_blank">Time-based One-time Password</a> (TOTP) algorithm. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management#multi-factor-authentication">Multi-factor authentication</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Email microchannels</strong><br>
The system now supports the <em>Microchannel</em> size for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management">email channels</a>. Email microchannels are available in all license tiers, but have a limit of <strong>5</strong> emails per microchannel. This limit restricts the maximum number of email items allowed in the channel, but not how many times these emails can be sent to recipients.</p>
<p>You can select the channel size when creating new email channels in the <em>Channel management</em> application, or switch the size for existing channels that do not exceed the maximum number of allowed emails.</p>


<p><strong>Mass asset upload</strong><br>
The <em>Content hub</em> application now allows users to <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#mass-asset-upload">mass upload</a> new files and automatically convert them to content item assets of a configured <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types#mass-asset-upload-configuration">content type</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Content item selector supports multiple content types</strong><br>
The content item selector form component now supports multiple allowed content types. You can specify multiple content types when using the selector in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">content type fields</a> or as an <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#combined-content-selector">editing component</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Retrieval of absolute URLs of pages</strong><br>
The <code>IWebPageUrlRetriever</code> interface now enables users to directly <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-page-content/retrieve-page-urls">retrieve absolute URLs</a> of web pages. The retrieved object now contains an <code>AboluteUrl</code> property in addition to the <code>RelativePath</code> property.</p>


<p><strong>‘Clicked email link with URL’ condition for contact groups and automation</strong><br>
A new condition is available for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact groups</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a>, which allows marketers to check if a contact has clicked a link with a specific URL within a selected email.</p>

</section>
<section id="updates-and-changes-8" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p><strong>.NET 8 in Kentico.Xperience.Templates projects</strong><br>
.NET project templates installed from the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kentico.Xperience.Templates" target="_blank">Kentico.Xperience.Templates</a> NuGet package version 29.6.0 and newer now target .NET 8 instead of .NET 6.</p>


<p><strong>End of preview mode for automation</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">Automation</a>, which was introduced in preview mode in refresh 29.4.0, is now released as a fully supported feature.</p>


<p><strong>Excluding jQuery from Form Builder and Page Builder scripts</strong><br>
This release removes the dependency of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder">Form Builder</a> client-side <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/reference-tag-helpers#page-builder-scripts">scripts</a> on the jQuery library. To maintain backward compatibility, users now control whether jQuery is linked on live site pages with Form Builder and Page Builder content. The behavior is configured via a new <code>CMSBuilderScriptsIncludeJQuery</code> setting (set using <em>appsettings.json</em>), which is <code>true</code> by default. Starting with the next major release (version 30.0.0), the setting will default to <code>false</code>, requiring explicit opt-in. All out-of-the-box builder features remain functional without jQuery. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/bundle-static-assets-of-builder-components#link-jquery-as-part-of-builder-scripts">Exclude jQuery from builder scripts</a>.</p>
<p>jQuery will be phased out completely in one of the future major releases. For projects with custom components that rely on the library, consider disabling it in Xperience and referencing an external implementation to prevent possible issues in the future.</p>


<p><strong>Detecting Page Builder read-only mode</strong><br>
Users now have the option to check the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> mode from a retrieved <code>IPageBuilderDataContext</code> instance via the <code>GetMode</code> method. The method returns a value from the <code>PageBuilderMode</code> enumeration. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/create-pages-with-editable-areas#establish-rendering-context">Establish rendering context</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Binary serialization support removed from generated Info classes</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects#generate-code-files">code generator</a> for <em>Info</em> classes no longer generates the following members:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Serializable</code> attribute annotating the class</li>
<li>constructor: protected (SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) : base(info, context)</li>
</ul>
<p>The support for this type of serialization is now obsolete. To remove these members from your custom classes, we recommend regenerating all <em>Info</em> classes after updating your project.</p>

<li>The <code>AuthenticateUrl</code> Razor extension method is now obsolete.

<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop-down selector UI form components incorrectly changed their height when a value was selected from an empty selector state.</li>
<li>The caching of administration requests for content item assets was improved to enhance the performance. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Admin UI authentication – The sign-in button for the administration incorrectly remained active even after being selected. On slower connections, this allowed users to select the button multiple times.</p></li>
<li><p>Admin UI customization – The content of UI page listings wasn’t reloaded after invoking the <code>Response().UseCommand('LoadData')</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-page-commands">UI page command</a>. The issue occurred on version 29.5.0 or newer.</p></li>
<li><p>Automation – Deleting a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms">form</a> that was configured to trigger an <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation process</a> also deleted the related process. After applying the update, the system prevents such forms from being deleted in the administration UI. Deleting such forms via the API only deletes the form and leaves the automation process.</p></li>
<li><p>CI/CD – The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">continuous integration</a> repository didn’t correctly maintain the latest state of content item relationships (references to other content items via the <em>Content items</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">data type</a>) that were edited via the admin UI. This could lead to errors when restoring the CI data, for example after deleting a linked content item. Projects using CI/CD should follow the steps outlined in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects#update-development-projects-with-continuous-integration">update instructions</a> to get their repository to the correct state.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Content hub</p>
<ul>
<li>Segments in the content folder breadcrumb navigation didn’t work correctly with all link operations provided by browsers (open in new tab, copy link address, etc.).</li>
<li>The dialog for renaming <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#content-folders">content folders</a> didn’t display notifications about unsaved changes when canceling or otherwise leaving the dialog.</li>
<li>The status of content items wasn’t displayed correctly in the admin UI breadcrumbs when viewing an item on the <em>Properties</em> or <em>Usage</em> tab.</li>
<li>The system incorrectly displayed “Access denied” notifications when a user created a new language version of a content item with only <em>View</em> or <em>Create</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">permissions</a> for the <em>Content hub</em> application. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headless tracking</p>
<ul>
<li>When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/headless-tracking#log-activities">logging</a> <em>Data input</em> activities using the headless tracking API, the values of contact fields weren’t validated to ensure correct maximum length.</li>
<li>When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/headless-tracking#log-activities">logging</a> <em>Data input</em> activities using the headless tracking API, values of the <em>ContactEmail</em> field weren’t validated to ensure correct email address format. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Pages – Images with multiple source URLs within page content weren’t resolved correctly in certain cases when the page was displayed in <em>Preview</em> mode or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a>. For example, the issue could occur for <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tags containing multiple <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements with <code>srcset</code> attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>UI form components – The <code>DisabledFolderIdsFilter</code> property of the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#content-item-folder-selector">Content folder selector</a> component’s <code>ContentFolderSelector</code> attribute didn’t work correctly, so it wasn’t possible to specify folders that cannot be selected.</p></li>
<li><p>Users – The system didn’t correctly refresh the admin UI authentication cookie when a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/user-management">user</a> changed the <em>User name</em> of their own account, which could lead to various errors while using the administration.</p></li>
<li><p>Website content – When a <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls">page URL</a> (system or vanity) was accessed and was not the canonical URL of the page, the redirect to the canonical URL incorrectly returned a non-lowercased URL in certain cases.</p></li>

<h2>Refresh (September 19, 2024)</h2>
<p><strong>version 29.5.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-9" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Vanity URLs</strong><br>
Editors can now configure pages to use short and human-readable <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls#edit-vanity-urls-of-pages">vanity URLs</a> for marketing, branding, sharing, and SEO purposes without the need for configuration in the website code. Editors can also select which URL (default system or vanity) is the <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls#select-the-canonical-url-of-pages">canonical URL</a> of a page.</p>


<p><strong>Activity logging for email link clicks</strong><br>
When recipients click links in <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">email</a> content, the system can now log the actions as <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-activities">activities</a> for individual contacts. These activities are available in addition to the anonymous email statistics that are tracked in current versions of Xperience by Kentico. Email activities allow marketers to <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">segment contacts</a>, personalize content, and make decisions based on the actions that your audience takes when viewing email channel content. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/track-email-statistics">Track email statistics</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>To ensure compliance with data protection regulations, email activity logging is not active by default. Developers need to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-email-tracking/log-email-activities#implement-an-email-tracking-activity-evaluator">implement logic</a> that decides when it is possible to track email activities for specific contacts, for example based on <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management">consents</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Member registration activity logging</strong><br>
The system now logs the new <em>Member registration</em> <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-activities">activity</a> when a visitor completes the <a href="/documentation/business-users/members">member</a> registration process. Registration activities allow you to segment your contacts, or set up <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a> for engaging with newly registered members.</p>
<p>For visitors who are tracked as <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contacts</a>, the activity is logged for the current contact. Otherwise, the activity is logged for an existing contact matching the member’s email address. If a matching contact cannot be found, a new “untracked” contact is created for the activity (based on <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities#activity-logging-based-on-legitimate-interest">legitimate interest</a>).</p>
<p>The system automatically maps the email address of newly registered members to the email of the corresponding contact (if the contact does not already have an email value). Developers can extend the mapping for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/registration-and-authentication/add-fields-to-member-objects">custom member fields</a> by implementing their own <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/contact-configuration/map-custom-member-fields-to-contacts#implement-the-custom-member-field-mapper">mapping service</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Automation improvements</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">Automation</a> now supports a new <em>Registration</em> trigger type, which allows you to set up processes for engaging with contacts who register as a <a href="/documentation/business-users/members">member</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Automation Builder now automatically pre-fills names for new steps based on their type, and the text displayed in steps is now fully customizable (only the exact step name is used).</p>


<p><strong>Content folder moving</strong><br>
The <em>Content hub</em> application now allows editors to move <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#content-folders">content folders</a> under a different folder, together with all subfolders and contained items.</p>


<p><strong>Filtering in the content folder selector</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#content-item-folder-selector">content folder selector</a> UI form component now allows developers to specify which content folders are disabled for selection.</p>


<p><strong>Admin UI development improvements</strong><br>
The <strong>UI tree</strong> in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/system-overview">System</a> application was extended to display URL parameters of individual UI pages.</p>


<p><strong>New SaaS deployment regions</strong><br>
Support for Canada East, UK West, Japan West, Australia Southeast, North Central US, and Switzerland North regions was added for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments">SaaS deployments</a>. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/saas-overview#where-is-the-saas-service-available">SaaS overview</a> for a list of all available regions.</p>

<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<p><strong>Generic provider updates</strong></p>
<p>Provider classes from the <em>CMS.OnlineMarketing</em> and <em>CMS.Activities</em> namespaces were made obsolete. Use the generic <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api#generic-provider-class-iinfoprovidertinfo">IInfoProvider</a> provider instead. Affected classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>CMS.OnlineMarketing.TrackedWebsiteInfoProvider</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>CMS.Activities.ActivityInfoProvider</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>CMS.Activities.ActivityTypeInfoProvider</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Admin UI page API</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>IPageUrlGenerator</code> service and the <code>IPageUrlGenerator.GenerateUrl</code> method for getting the URLs of administration <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages">UI pages</a> were made obsolete. Use the new <code>IPageLinkGenerator</code> service and <code>IPageLinkGenerator.GetPath</code> method instead, which provide more robust URL generating in cases where new path segments are added to UI page URLs.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>UIPage</code> attribute with the <code>icon</code> parameter was made obsolete. The new <code>UIPage</code> attribute uses an <code>Icon</code> property instead.</p></li>
<li><p>API members for setting URL parameter values for UI pages via a <code>string []</code> array were made obsolete (for example <code>PageConfiguration.AddEditRowAction</code>). Use the new API which replaces the array parameter with the <code>PageParameterValues</code> class.</p></li>

<p><strong>Smart folder selector attribute</strong></p>
<p>When assigning the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#smart-folder-selector">Smart folder selector</a> UI form component to properties, the <code>SmartFolderSelectorComponent</code> attribute constructor with the <code>contentTypeFilter</code> parameter is now obsolete.</p>
<p>Instead, use the attribute constructor without parameters and assign the filter type into the corresponding attribute property – either <code>AllowedContentTypeIdentifiersFilter</code> or <code>AllowedReusableFieldSchemaIdentifiersFilter</code>.</p>

<section id="fixed-issues-9" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Admin UI authentication – If an unauthenticated user attempted to access an administration page while the application was configured to use an <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/administration-registration-and-authentication/administration-external-authentication">external authentication provider</a> for the admin UI, the <em>returnUrl</em> query string parameter was lost during the redirection to the authentication provider. As a result, the administration dashboard was always displayed after successfully signing in instead of the originally request admin UI page.</p></li>
<li><p>Administration – If <code>IWebsiteChannelContext</code> was used to get the current <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a> within the context of the administration interface, an incorrect channel could be returned based on the domain in the current request’s URL. After the update, <code>IWebsiteChannelContext</code> only works when called within the context of website channel pages, and does not return a value for administration interface requests.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Automation</p>
<ul>
<li>If an existing contact submitted a form with an email value that didn’t match the contact’s current email address, any <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a> (or autoresponders) configured for the form were incorrectly triggered for the current contact, instead of running for the contact matching the submitted email address. This could cause inconsistencies in autoresponder and automation emails sent as a result of the form submission.</li>
<li>Resizing the browser window while working in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation#create-an-automation-process">Automation Builder</a> could cause all unsaved changes to be lost if the window size was reduced enough to trigger a switch to the mobile layout. After the update, the mobile layout switch does not occur if unsaved changes are detected. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content hub</p>
<ul>
<li>After switching from a <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#smart-folders">smart folder</a> to a <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#content-folders">content folder</a>, the smart folder’s filtering condition remained applied to the list of items displayed for the selected content folder.</li>
<li>An error could occur in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#find-content-items">content item filter</a> dialog after switching the time frame of the <em>Last modified</em> or <em>Last published</em> option while having a date selected in the other option. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Content item API – <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api">Content item query</a> calls for retrieving items from a smart folder resulted in an error if the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query">query parameterization</a> included both <code>InSmartFolder</code> and <code>WithContentTypeFields</code>, but did not select specific content types using either <code>OfContentType</code> or <code>OfReusableSchema</code>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>General – Connection-related errors originating from background system services</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In rare cases, the system could generate connection-related errors in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/event-log">event log</a>, originating from background long-running services supporting the system. The only solution was to restart the application. Error examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not allowed to change the <code>ConnectionString</code> property. The connection’s current state is closed.</li>
<li>There is already an open <code>DataReader</code> associated with this <code>Connection</code> which must be closed first.</li>
<li>Invalid operation. The connection is closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page Builder</p>
<ul>
<li>Users could submit a form using the <em>Form</em> widget while editing website channel pages in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/widgets-and-page-builder">Page Builder</a> view mode.</li>
<li>Users without the <em>Update</em> page permission could access the editable mode of Page Builder for website channel pages under certain conditions. However, any changes made this way could not be saved. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Permissions – Page preview URLs could be accessed by users who had their <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/page-permission-management">page permissions</a> removed after the link was generated.</p></li>

<p>Updates and changes</p>
<div data-entry="" data-entry-update="">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Submitted data can no longer modify the current contact’s email address</strong></p>
<p>When users submit data via a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms#map-form-submission-to-contact-attributes">form submission</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/headless-tracking#log-activities">headless tracking Data input activity</a>, or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/cross-site-tracking#data-input">cross-site tracking Data input activity</a>, this data can be mapped to the fields of the associated <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contact</a>. After this update, such actions can no longer be used to change the email address of the current contact.</p>
<p>If the contact already has an email address stored in Xperience that doesn’t match the new email value, all related activities and field updates are performed for a different contact. Either an existing contact that matches the submitted email value is used, or a new contact is created. In these cases, the user’s associated contact remains unchanged (stored in a browser cookie on websites), but any subsequent actions, such as <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation processes</a>, are performed for the “other” contact that matches the submitted email address.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">API – It was not possible to correctly call the system’s API via an <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/use-the-xperience-by-kentico-api-externally">external application</a> with only the <em>Kentico.Xperience.Core</em> NuGet package installed. Users could encounter issues with service resolution and database connection, for example. Applying the hotfix fixes the issues and changes the steps required to connect an external application to the system. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/use-the-xperience-by-kentico-api-externally#web-applications">Configure external web applications</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/use-the-xperience-by-kentico-api-externally#non-web-applications-console-applications-etc.">Configure external regular applications</a> for details.</span></p></li>

<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Automation – When a trigger of an <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">automation process</a> was deleted, it remained stored in the database.

<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Content hub – The toolbar of the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a> didn’t stick to the top of the edited field if the field’s content spanned more than the viewport height.</span></p></li>

<h2>Refresh (August 22, 2024)</h2>
<p><strong>version 29.4.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-10" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Automation</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation">Automation</a> allows you to set up processes that dynamically interact with your audience. Marketers design the steps within each process using a visual Automation Builder interface. In the current version, you can use automation to set up advanced email follow-ups when a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">form</a> is submitted. With automation, you can send a series of multiple emails, add waiting intervals, or send different emails based on conditions.</p>


<p><strong>Smart folder dynamic content delivery</strong><br>
Dynamic content delivery can now be enabled for <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#smart-folders">smart folders</a>. This allows developers to retrieve items matching a smart folder’s filter criteria, and gives content editors the power to control which items are delivered directly in the <em>Content hub</em> UI, without needing to adjust code.</p>
<p>Such folders can be selected using the new <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#smart-folder-selector">Smart folder selector</a> UI form component, for example in dedicated fields of <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">website channel pages</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">reusable content items</a>, or in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/widgets-for-page-builder/widget-properties">Page Builder widget</a> properties. Developers can then use such fields to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-content-items#retrieve-content-items-from-smart-folders">retrieve</a> content items from the selected smart folder.</p>


<p><strong>Smart folder cloning</strong><br>
New option to clone <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#smart-folders">smart folders</a>, which allows users to quickly create new smart folders with the same filter criteria as an existing folder.</p>


<p><strong>Smart folder properties</strong><br>
Users can now view the properties of <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#smart-folders">smart folders</a> in the <em>Content hub</em> application. The properties include the folder’s identifiers, created and last modified timestamps, as well as other metadata.</p>


<p><span id="pbreadonly-29-4-0"></span> <strong>Improved Page Builder read-only mode</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> now allows you to copy widgets and sections, view widget/section properties, and browse available widget personalization variants on pages in a non-editable status (e.g., <em>Published</em> and <em>Unpublished</em>).</p>


<p><strong>Last published filtering in Content hub</strong><br>
The Content hub listing was extended to allow editors to filter items based on their Last published date and time. This new option can also be used in the filter criteria of smart folders.</p>


<p><strong>Listing filter UI improvements</strong><br>
When a filter is applied to a listing in the administration (and when viewing a smart folder), hovering over the filter tiles above the listing now displays information about the value set for the matching filter condition.</p>


<p><strong>Public API for page permission management</strong><br>
The new public <code>WebPageAclManager</code> <a href="/api/content-management/page-permissions">API</a> allows developers to manage <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/page-permission-management">page permissions</a>. The API can be useful when managing website content programmatically.</p>


<p><strong>Multiple allowed email purposes for the email selector</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#email-selector">email selector</a> UI form component was extended with the <code>AllowedEmailPurposes</code> property, which allows developers to set multiple allowed email purposes.</p>

<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<p><strong>Generic provider updates</strong><br>
The following Info providers in the <em>CMS.EmailMarketing</em> and <em>CMS.EmailEngine</em> namespace were made obsolete. Use the generic <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api#generic-provider-class-iinfoprovidertinfo">IInfoProvider<tinfo></tinfo></a> provider instead. This is a continuation of the effort to replace dedicated providers with the generic approach. The interfaces for these providers were made obsolete in the <a href="#refresh-march-21-2024">March 2024 Refresh</a>.</p>
<p><em>CMS.EmailMarketing</em> namespace:</p>

<h3>Fixed issues – security</h3>

<p><strong>Stored XSS in Checkbox form component</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/reference-form-builder-components">Checkbox</a> component in Form Builder was vulnerable to Cross-Site-Scripting attack (XSS). To eliminate this vulnerability, support for HTML in Checkbox component was removed.</p>

<section id="fixed-issues-10" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>AIRA – When an <a href="/documentation/business-users/aira#email-subject-fields">email subject suggestion</a> was clicked in the <em>Generate with AI</em> dialog and inserted into the email subject field, the <em>Save</em> button didn’t become active unless another change was made in the email’s editing form.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>More actions</em> menu for listing page mass actions wasn’t displayed correctly in the <em>Content hub</em> application. The more actions menu appears when the mass actions available for a listing page cannot fit into the width of the viewing device.</li>
<li>The date string of the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#date-input">Date</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#datetime-input">DateTime</a> selector component could overflow the designated input field when displayed on some browsers. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Channels – It is now possible to set an additional website domain via the admin UI (<em>Channel management</em> → edit a channel → <em>General</em> tab) for channels with <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#domain-aliases-and-environment-specific-domains">domains and domain aliases</a> set via application configuration. Domains set via the admin UI were previously disregarded for such channels. Domains configured this way behave as additional domain aliases.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Content hub</p>
<ul>
<li>If multiple <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies">taxonomy tags</a> were selected in a <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders">smart folder’s</a> filter condition, but one of the tags was later deleted, the entire <em>Taxonomy</em> condition was cleared for the folder, and the folder’s items weren’t displayed correctly.</li>
<li>When a user switched between folders in the content item selector, any selection of items was cleared, which prevented the selection of items from different <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders">folders</a>. After the update, item selection persists when switching between folders. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>General – Changes made to channel configuration in one <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/auto-scaling-support">auto-scaling</a> instance were not properly reflected in other auto-scaling instances.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Page Builder</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved security of certain <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> endpoints.</li>
<li>When more than 12 <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/widgets-and-page-builder">widgets</a> were available in the Page Builder widget selection dialog, widgets without a defined <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/widgets-for-page-builder#register-widgets">icon class</a> had their names incorrectly trimmed.</li>
<li>Widget <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/content-personalization/develop-personalization-condition-types">personalization condition types</a> without specified properties could not be created. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Performance – The process of <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#move-pages">moving pages</a> in a website channel application was optimized to reduce the time required for the action. The improvement mainly affects the movement of a large number of pages at once.</p></li>
<li><p>Rich text editor – After using the <em>Refine text with AI</em> option in a <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text field</a> with enabled <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/aira-configuration">AI features</a>, the content of selection dialogs for the <em>Insert image</em> and <em>Insert link</em> editor options wasn’t loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>Website content – Changing the primary language of a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a> caused an error in certain edge cases.</p></li>

<h2>Refresh (July 25, 2024)</h2>
<p><strong>version 29.3.0</strong></p>
<section id="important-manual-update-steps" data-section="" data-section-special="">
<h3>Important – Manual update steps</h3>

<p>One of the features introduced by this release is <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#track-usage-of-content-items">usage tracking</a>, which monitors references between content items in the system. For usage tracking to function correctly, the system needs to find and store all existing references during the update.</p>
<h4 id="before-the-update">Before the update</h4>
<p>The automatic update procedure is capable of handling references created using the default <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#combined-content-selector">content item selector</a> components. However, if your project uses any custom solutions for storing content item references, such as a custom URL selector, or a custom rich text inline editor, you need to follow a specific update procedure for this refresh:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update the project’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects#update-nuget-packages">NuGet packages</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Before updating the database</strong>, you need to implement <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-reference-extractors">reference extractors</a> for any content type fields or Page Builder component properties containing references to reusable content items added via custom <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components">UI form components</a> or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/widgets-for-page-builder/inline-editors-for-widget-properties">inline editors</a>.</li>
<li>Update the project’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects#update-data-and-files">database and file system</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you update your project’s database before implementing the necessary reference extractors, usage tracking will report results inconsistent with the true state of your project. Contact <a href="https://www.kentico.com/services/support" target="_blank">Kentico support</a> for assistance if you encounter any issues or perform the database update before implementing reference extractors.</p>
<h4 id="after-the-update">After the update</h4>
<p>After performing the update, you need to change the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">data type</a> of all fields that use the <em>Rich text editor</em> form component to a new data type: <em>Rich text (HTML)</em>. Using <em>Text</em> and <em>Long text</em> data types together with the <em>Rich text editor</em> form component is now obsolete. The <em>Rich text (HTML)</em> data type uses the same database representation as <em>Text</em> and <em>Long text</em>, so you can switch the data types in the <em>Content types</em> application. Content types with the obsolete combination of data types and <em>Rich text editor</em> form components display a warning on their <em>Fields</em> tab. Content item usage is tracked in the affected fields but this is likely to change in the future.</p>
<p>You can use the following code snippet to run an automatic one-time conversion of all affected fields to the new data type. Call the <code>ConvertTextAndLongTextTypesToRichText</code> method, for example, on application startup after initializing Kentico services.</p>

<h3>Product instance licensing changes</h3>

<p>Beginning with this release (July 25, 2024 onwards, product version 29.3.0 and later), Xperience by Kentico is introducing support for a new license key format. This change allows the system to track and inform clients about contractual violations related to product usage.</p>
<p>Note that changes introduced by this version primarily concern projects that plan to maintain version parity with the latest Xperience by Kentico releases. Projects running Xperience by Kentico versions lower than 29.3.0 <strong>are not</strong> retroactively affected. Such projects can continue using the current license keys until otherwise indicated or until you wish to update to a newer version.</p>
<p>Please carefully read the following sections to familiarize yourselves with the possible impact on your projects.</p>
<h4 id="transition-period">Transition period</h4>
<p>The product is entering a <em>three-month</em> transition period lasting until the <strong>October 2024 Refresh</strong> release. During this period, both the current license key format (managed via the <em>License keys</em> application) and the new one will be active and available in the product side by side. You can seamlessly switch your projects to the new format without any downtime.</p>
<p>The <em>October 2024 Refresh</em> release will remove support for the current license key format. <strong>All projects updated to the October 2024 Refresh release or newer</strong> will need to switch to the new licenses.</p>
<h4 id="changes-to-license-key-management">Changes to license key management</h4>
<p>The <em>License keys</em> application is becoming obsolete and will be removed in the October 2024 Refresh release. License keys in the new format are managed via the <em>Settings</em> application under <em>System -&gt; Licenses</em>.</p>
<p>Clients can generate the new keys via <a href="https://client.kentico.com/" target="_blank">Client Portal</a>. The NEW label on the key generator buttons indicates key generators for the new license keys.</p>
<p>To replace your current license keys with new ones:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sign in to <a href="https://client.kentico.com/" target="_blank">Client Portal</a>.</li>
<li>Under license management, generate license keys in the new format.</li>
<li>In your Xperience instance, open <em>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Licenses</em>.</li>
<li>Insert the license key into the <em>License key</em> setting and save the changes.</li>
<li>Remove all obsolete license keys from the <em>License keys</em> application.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new licensing model requires a single license key for each Xperience instance. You no longer need to generate a key per channel domain. Contact <a href="mailto:sales@kentico.com" target="_self">sales@kentico.com</a> if you have any questions or require assistance.</p>
<h4 id="license-keys-are-no-longer-bound-to-domains">License keys are no longer bound to domains</h4>
<p>Unlike the current license key model, which requires a separate license key for each domain used by the product (e.g., for website and email channels, or domain aliases), the new license keys are not bound to individual domains. Each Xperience by Kentico instance requires only a single license key.</p>
<h4 id="product-documentation">Product documentation</h4>
<p>Product documentation related to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/licenses">licensing</a> was updated to reflect the newly introduced approach. The documentation will contain information about both licensing models until the end of the transition period, marked by the release of the <em>October 2024 Refresh</em>. All information related to the old licensing process will be removed from that point onward.</p>

</section>
<section id="new-features-11" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Page permissions</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/page-permission-management">Page permissions</a> allow you to manage and scope permissions to website channels, specific content tree sections, and individual pages. To enable the management of permissions on a page level, the usual <em>View</em>, <em>Create</em>, <em>Update</em>, and <em>Delete</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">permissions</a> set for a whole website channel in the <strong>Role management</strong> application were replaced by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Access channel</em> and <em>Manage permissions</em> permissions for individual website channel applications managed in the <strong>Role management</strong> application</li>
<li>
<em>Display</em>, <em>Read</em>, <em>Create</em>, <em>Update</em>, and <em>Delete</em> page permissions managed directly from within the website channel application</li>
</ul>
<p>To support a seamless transition to page permissions, certain roles automatically gain the following permissions after applying the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles with the <em>Update</em> permission for the <strong>Role management</strong> application gain the <em>Manage permissions</em> permission.</li>
<li>Roles with any permissions for a particular website channel application gain the <em>Access channel</em> permission for the application and, within it, all corresponding page permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page permissions are not included in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd">CI/CD</a> data. After performing a CI/CD restore operation, any moved and newly created pages inherit permissions from their new parent page.</p>


<p><strong>Usage tracking</strong><br>
Content editors can now in content throughout the system to help them make informed decisions when editing or deleting already published content. The <em>Usage</em> tab is now available for all content items in the <em>Content hub</em>. It contains a listing of reusable items and channel items that link to the currently viewed content item using the content item selector or the rich text editor.</p>


<p><strong>Channel type conversion</strong><br>
Headless and website channels can now be converted between microchannels and regular channels using the <em>General</em> tab when editing a channel in the <em>Channel management</em> application.</p>


<p><strong>Workflow roles with control over all steps</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/workflows">Workflows</a> can now be configured to have a set of roles with “full control” (in addition to roles assigned to individual workflow steps). Users in these roles can work with all steps in the workflow, and also directly publish items from any step.</p>


<p><strong>Scheduled maintenance of Xperience Portal projects</strong><br>
To minimize the possible negative effects of on your Xperience Portal projects, you can now choose specific weekdays and timeslots during which your projects can be updated in the <em>System → Update schedule</em> Xperience Portal application.</p>
<p><strong>SaaS US West deployment regions</strong><br>
Support for the West US and West US 2 regions was added for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments">SaaS deployments</a>.</p>


<p><strong>E-commerce integration – Shopify</strong><br>
Allows you to connect your Shopify store with an Xperience by Kentico application using <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront" target="_blank">Shopify Storefront</a> and <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin" target="_blank">Shopify Admin</a> APIs. The integration provides synchronization of products and e-commerce actions between the two platforms. For more information and detailed instructions, see the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-shopify" target="_blank">Xperience by Kentico Shopify integration</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p><strong>E-commerce integration – Kentico Xperience 13</strong><br>
Allows you to connect a <a href="/13/e-commerce-features">Kentico Xperience 13 store</a> with an Xperience by Kentico application. The integration is primarily intended to enable migration of existing Kentico Xperience 13 E-Commerce projects to Xperience by Kentico, but can also be used for other scenarios. For more information and detailed instructions, see the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-k13ecommerce" target="_blank">Xperience by Kentico - Kentico Xperience 13 E-commerce</a> GitHub repository.</p>

<h3>Obsolete data types for Rich text fields</h3>

<p>The combination of using the <em>Rich text editor</em> form component with <em>Text</em> or <em>Long text</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">data types</a> in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">field editor</a> is now obsolete. If you want to use the <em>Rich text editor</em> form component, use the new <em>Rich text (HTML)</em> data type.

<section id="fixed-issues-11" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>CI/CD – Under certain circumstances, working with pages under one website channel could also influence the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd">CI/CD</a> repository structure of pages in other website channels.</p></li>
<li><p>Former URLs – When filtering <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls#former-urls">former URLs</a> based on dates, the UI displayed an incorrectly named label in the list of applied filters.</p></li>
<li><p>General – Removing variable-length fields (<em>nvarchar</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">data types</a>) from system objects (content types, object types) could end in a database timeout for objects with a large number of records (~hundreds of thousands). The timeout could be caused by a database size optimization that was run every time a variable-length database column (backing the corresponding removed field) was dropped. The fix for the issue disables this automatic optimization and only runs it during CI/CD database restore. If users need to optimize the database size outside of CI/CD restore operations, they can use the new <em>Optimize database size</em> action added to the <em>Overview</em> tab of the <em>System overview</em> application. The action runs the equivalent of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-cleantable-transact-sql" target="_blank">DBCC CLEANTABLE</a> over the connected database.</p></li>
<li><p>Installation – When creating a new database via <code>kentico-xperience-dbmanager</code>, default system user accounts were incorrectly created with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.identityuser-1.securitystamp" target="_blank">security stamp</a> column set to NULL.</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – An error occurred when using a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/widgets-for-page-builder#register-widgets">widget</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/sections-for-page-builder#register-sections">section</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/page-templates-for-page-builder#register-page-templates">page template</a>, or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/content-personalization/develop-personalization-condition-types#register-condition-types">personalization condition</a> that was registered with an identifier starting with a lowercase character.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance – An excessive number of database queries was used when loading pages in the content tree of <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">website channel applications</a>. The performance of the content tree was optimized to improve load times for website channels containing a very large number of pages.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Website content</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the order of <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#move-pages">website pages</a> in one <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a> could affect the order in other website channels.</li>
<li>UI components that allowed selection of pages (<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#page-selector">page selector</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#url-selector">URL selector</a>, <em>Insert link</em> dialog in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a>) with a limited tree path incorrectly allowed users to select pages under the website root in some circumstances. </li>

<h2>Refresh (June 27, 2024)</h2>
<p><strong>version 29.2.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-12" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Smart folders in Content hub</strong><br>
The <em>Content hub</em> application was extended to support <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#smart-folders">smart folders</a>, which provide a new dynamic way to organize and filter content items. Each smart folder is based on a filtering condition, such as “items modified in the last 7 days”, “items with the <em>Draft status</em>”, “items with the <em>Acme</em> tag”, etc. The condition is evaluated dynamically, so items move in and out of smart folders as their fields and metadata change. A single content item can belong into any number of smart folders. Smart folders are also available in all content item selectors throughout the system.</p>


<p><strong>Scheduled unpublishing of pages and content items</strong><br>
”Archive” functionality for content items, website channel pages and headless items was renamed to “Unpublish”, which better reflects the feature’s intended purpose. When unpublishing <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#unpublish-content-items">content items</a> or <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#unpublish-pages">pages</a>, editors can now choose whether to unpublish immediately or schedule the unpublish to a future date and time.</p>


<p><strong>Scheduling support for cascade publishing</strong><br>
When scheduling a <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#scheduled-publishing">content item</a> or <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#scheduled-publishing">website channel page</a> to be published, the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#cascade-publishing">cascade publishing</a> feature now schedules linked items to be published at the same time, rather than publishing them immediately.</p>


<p><strong>Microchannels</strong><br>
The system now supports the creation of <em>microchannels</em>. Microchannels can contain at most 20 content items of the specific channel type – pages for website channels and headless items for headless channels. You can select the channel size when creating new channels in the <em>Channel management</em> application. Microchannels are not supported for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management">Email channels</a>.</p>


<p><strong>User interface improvements</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#email-selector">Email selector</a> was extended to display the <em>Status</em> column in the list of emails available for selection. Additionally, any disabled emails in the selector now have tooltips explaining why the email cannot be selected.</p>


<p><strong>Extended support for admin UI listing page filters</strong><br>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/reference-ui-page-templates/listing-ui-page-template#add-a-listing-filter">Filter models</a> for admin UI listing pages were extended to support <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-validation-rules">validation rules</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-visibility-conditions">visibility conditions</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/editing-components/configure-editing-component-state">component state configurators</a>. Additionally, new attributes provide the option to set the filter summary text that appears above the listing for individual filter properties, and add properties that appear in the filter UI, but do not affect the resulting filtering condition. This allows developers to create more advanced filters for UI listing pages.</p>


<p><strong>SaaS East US 2 deployment region</strong><br>
Support for the East US 2 region was added for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments">SaaS deployments</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="updates-and-changes-10" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>API – The <code>WhereIn</code> and <code>WhereNotIn</code> WHERE condition parameterization methods used by the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query">content item</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/objectquery-api">object query</a> API were extended with overloads accepting <code>IEnumerable</code> in addition to <code>ICollection</code>.</li>
<li>Content management – All “Archive” terminology in the administration interface and API was renamed to “Unpublish”.</li>
<li>Content hub – The <em>Authentication</em> column was removed in the <em>Content hub</em> listing. Instead, a “secured” icon is displayed in the <em>Status</em> column for items that require authentication.</li>
<li>General – The names of certain objects (<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies">taxonomies</a>, tags, <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders">content hub folders</a>) no longer need to be unique. This applies to “display names” that appear in the user interface. The code names of objects still must be globally unique.</li>
<li>Rich text editor
<ul>
<li>The code view of the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">Rich text editor</a> no longer highlights code syntax.</li>
<li>The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/widgets-for-page-builder/rich-text-inline-editors">inline rich text editor</a> used in Page Builder widgets no longer displays the word counter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User interface – Switching between pages in the pagination UI for the listing in the <em>Content hub</em> application now automatically scrolls to the top of the items displayed for the page.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="new-object-types-for-cicd-6" data-section="" data-section-ci-cd="">
<h3>New object types for CI/CD</h3>

<p>The update introduces the following object types, which are supported by the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> features. Consider updating the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories">repository.config</a> files of your CI/CD repositories, particularly when using the <code>&lt;IncludedObjectTypes&gt;</code> allowlist for object type filtering.</p>
<ul>
<li>cms.smartfolder – stores <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#smart-folders">smart folders</a>, which are used to dynamically categorize and filter items in the <em>Content hub</em> application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<p><strong>“Archive” API</strong><br>
All content management API with the “Archive” keyword (e.g., <code>IContentItemManager.TryArchive</code>, <code>WebPageEvents.Archive</code>, <code>VersionStatus.Archived</code>) was made obsolete. Use the new replacement API with the “Unpublish” keyword.</p>

<section id="fixed-issues-security-3" data-section="" data-section-security-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues – security</h3>

<p>Requests to endpoints under the <code>/admin</code> path returned incorrect HTTP status codes in certain cases. To improve security, the following changes were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requests to endpoints under the <code>/admin</code> path now return a 400 HTTP status code if anti-forgery token validation fails.</li>
<li>Requests to non-existing endpoints under the <code>/admin</code> path now return a 404 HTTP status code.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-12" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>A horizontal scrollbar was incorrectly displayed in tree listings (e.g., taxonomy tree, website channel content tree) whenever a vertical scrollbar was required. The horizontal scrollbar is not necessary anymore, as all tree listings are resizable.</li>
<li>Attempting to change the data type of a field via an object’s <em>Fields</em> tab to an incompatible data type (for example, <em>Date</em> to <em>Long text</em>) caused a crash in the editing interface that required a full page reload to recover. After applying the refresh, an error message is shown instead.</li>
<li>Buttons that were disabled (e.g., due to insufficient user permissions) didn’t show tooltips when hovered.</li>
<li>The <em>Change workflow step</em> button in content management applications was missing a tooltip in scenarios where the button was inactive for the current user.</li>
<li>The pagination UI for the listing in the <em>Content hub</em> application didn’t display page numbers correctly if there were many pages of items.</li>
<li>The website channel content tree displayed an incorrect icon for <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">pages</a> that weren’t translated in the currently selected <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">language</a>, but had an existing language variant that was scheduled to be published.</li>
<li>Trees in the administration UI (e.g., the <em>Content hub</em> folder tree) didn’t scroll to the currently selected item when this was required to show the item after reloading the page.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#find-content-items">Filtering</a> configuration was incorrectly shared among all channel applications in an instance. After applying the refresh, filters can be configured independently for each channel application. However, the fix also invalidates all existing filter configurations, which need to be set up again. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admin UI customization</p>
<ul>
<li>Actions handled by custom components added via <code>Page.PageConfiguration.HeaderActions.AddActionWithCustomComponent</code> to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/reference-ui-page-templates/listing-ui-page-template">listing page</a> header actions didn’t work correctly.</li>
<li>Links in a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/reference-ui-page-templates/listing-ui-page-template">listing UI page</a> didn’t open in a new tab even though the <code>Target</code> property of <code>ActionConfiguration.LinkParameters</code> of <code>TableActions</code> was set to <code>"_blank"</code>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cascade publishing – If an item was selected in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#cascade-publishing">cascade publishing</a> dialog and another action in the system prevented the item from being published (for example if the user lost permissions, or the item was meanwhile published by another user), the item incorrectly remained selected after the dialog was reloaded via the <em>Refresh</em> button. The issue only occurred in the cascade publishing dialog that appeared when <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#mass-publishing">mass publishing</a> items in the <em>Content hub</em> application.</p></li>
<li><p>Content hub folders – The <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders">content hub folder</a> tree wasn’t refreshed after renaming a folder, which could cause the folders to be displayed out of alphabetical order until the page was reloaded.</p></li>
<li><p>General – System routes were not registered correctly when using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-8.0#branch-the-middleware-pipeline" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core pipeline branching</a> for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/website-development-basics/configure-new-projects#configure-application-startup">middleware registration</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Headless channels</p>
<ul>
<li>After applying the 29.1.4 update, the <a href="/documentation/business-users/headless-content">headless item</a> selector component didn’t work correctly.</li>
<li>After selecting the <a href="/documentation/business-users/headless-content#preview-headless-items">Preview button</a>, the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management#create-headless-channels">Preview URL</a> didn’t open in a new tab but was instead appended to the current URL, and a general error page was shown. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Media libraries – Attempting to upload a file with a name that already exists in the media library resulted in an error if the original file had a thumbnail attached. This issue occurred only in media libraries mapped to Azure storage.</p></li>
<li><p>Website content – Deleting the ‘Draft’ <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content#page-lifecycle">version</a> of a page could result in an error on the live site due to incorrectly cleared cache.</p></li>

The issue was caused by an update in the underlying operating system libraries (specifically, <a href="https://icu.unicode.org/" target="_blank">libicu</a>), which changed the structure of the output DateTime format string. Applying the hotfix prevents a possible occurrence of the issue for Windows and MacOS as well, should a similar library update occur on those platforms in the future.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Content items – Pages referencing reusable content items via fields belonging to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schemas</a> could lose such references when the page used <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> and contained a widget that could also reference reusable content items via its fields.

<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Scheduled publishing of pages and content items</strong><br>
When publishing <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">content items</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">website channel pages</a>, editors can now choose whether to publish immediately or select a date and time when the publish will occur.</p>


<p><strong>Time values in the administration displayed in the user’s local time zone</strong><br>
All time values in the administration are now automatically converted and displayed in the local time zone of each user, based on browser and environment settings. For example: 01:30 PM (GMT+02:00). Internally, time values are stored in the time zone of the server where the application is running (exactly like in previous versions of Xperience by Kentico).</p>


<p><strong>‘Contact has value in field’ condition for contact groups</strong><br>
A new <em>Contact has value in field</em> condition is available for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact groups</a>. This condition is fulfilled for contacts whose value in a selected field meets the specified requirements.</p>


<p><strong>Taxonomy support for headless and email channels</strong><br>
Fields with the <em>Taxonomy</em> data type can now also be added to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a> for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/headless-content">headless items</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Improved filtering in content hub, headless and email channel applications</strong><br>
The listing in content hub, headless and email channel applications now allows editors to filter items based on assigned tags. Additionally, the listing in email channel applications also now allows editors to filter emails based on their <em>Status</em>.</p>


<p><strong>Content hub folder properties</strong><br>
Users can now view the properties of <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders">folders</a> in the Content hub application. The properties include the folder’s ID, code name, created and last modified timestamps, as well as other metadata.</p>


<p><strong>API for managing content hub folders</strong><br>
New <a href="/api/content-management/content-hub-folders">public API</a> that allows developers to manage content hub folders, and move items between folders. The API can be useful when implementing integrations or migrating content.</p>


<p><strong>Improved reusable field schemas visualization on the content type ‘Fields’ tab</strong><br>
When editing content types on the <em>Fields</em> tab, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schema</a> placeholder elements now display all fields that constitute the assigned schema. Selecting the edit icon (<span></span>) redirects you to the editing interface for the corresponding schema.</p>


<p><strong>New content item query methods for reusable field schemas</strong><br>
Developers can now use the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query#FCT-LinkingSchemaField">LinkingSchemaField</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query#FCT-LinkedFromSchemaField">LinkedFromSchemaField</a> methods when parameterizing data retrieval using content item queries. <code>LinkingSchemaField</code> retrieves all content items that link to at least one item from the provided input collection via a reusable schema field. <code>LinkedFromSchemaField</code> retrieves all content items linked from a reusable schema field belonging to items from the provided input collection.</p>


<p><strong>User interface improvements</strong><br>
The editing experience was improved with two new improvements to the administration interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editors can open a <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content#preview">preview of pages</a> in a new tab from the page actions menu.</li>
<li>Editors can resize tree UI components throughout the system to improve navigation with multiple expanded levels (e.g., in website channel applications, the page selector, <em>Settings</em> application, <em>Taxonomies</em> application).</li>
</ul>

<section id="updates-and-changes-11" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Content management – The names and icons of <em>Draft</em> item statuses were unified across all content-related applications (<em>Content hub</em> as well as website, email, and headless channel applications). The status names are now <em>Draft (Initial)</em> for new items that haven’t been published yet, and <em>Draft (New version)</em> for published items with a new version that is being edited.</li>
<li>Email templates – The <em>Email templates</em> application was moved in the administration’s application list from the <em>Digital marketing</em> category to <em>Configuration</em>.</li>
<li>Forms – <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/manage-form-submissions">Form submissions</a> are now ordered according to their submission date and time in <em>descending</em> order (the latest form submissions are displayed first).</li>

<li><p>Cascade publishing – The <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#cascade-publishing">cascade publishing</a> dialog didn’t work correctly in cases where another action caused the publish operation to be invalid (for example if the user lost permissions, or the item was meanwhile published by another user). Error states weren’t displayed correctly for items that could not be published for such reasons, and in certain cases the dialog became stuck in a loading state after clicking the <em>Publish</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Channels – When using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/auto-scaling-support">auto-scaling</a> in a project with multiple channels, a newly created channel application in one Xperience instance didn’t properly show up in the UI of the other instances.</p></li>
<li><p>Content hub folders – If the name of a <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders">content hub folder</a> contained multiple whitespace characters in a sequence, they were displayed only as a single space in the folder tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Content item API – The content item query <code>TopN</code> method, when used together with <code>Where</code> in a <code>ForContentType.Parameters()</code> statement, could sometimes return an empty result due to an incorrect application of the TOP N clause in the resulting SQL query.</p></li>
<li><p>Forms – <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">Forms</a> with the <em>reCAPTCHA</em> form component couldn’t be submitted in certain cases.

<li><p>Workflow – Deleting, creating and reordering a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/workflows">workflow’s</a> steps could in certain cases cause the steps to be displayed in the wrong order in the <em>Change workflow</em> step dialog (when moving pages, emails or items between steps). The update prevents the issue from occurring, but any affected workflows need to be fixed manually after the update – drag the workflow’s last step to the first position and then back again. This ensures correct recalculation of the order for all steps.</p></li>

<h2>Refresh (April 18, 2024)</h2>
<p><strong>version 29.0.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-14" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Content hub folders</strong><br>
The <em>Content hub</em> application now allows users to create a hierarchy of <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders">folders</a> for organizing content items. The purpose of folders is to help efficiently navigate through content items in the administration interface. However, these folders cannot be used to control content delivery or filter content on the live website.</p>


<p><strong>Mass publishing in Content hub</strong><br>
The <em>Content hub</em> application now supports <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#mass-publishing">mass publishing</a> of content items.</p>


<p><strong>Scope content items offered by content item selector by reusable field schemas</strong><br>
The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#combined-content-selector">content item selector</a> UI form component can now filter content items according to assigned reusable field schemas. Content item selectors configured via the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">field editor</a> can now select the <em>Allowed reusable field schema</em> option. For model-driven forms such as widget property dialogs, implement the <code>IReusableFieldSchemasFilter</code> interface and assign it using the <code>ContentItemSelectorComponent</code> attribute. See the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#combined-content-selector">content item selector documentation</a> for an example.</p>
<p>When retrieving fields scoped by reusable field schemas via content item query, use the <code>OfReusableSchema</code> parameterization.</p>
<p>When retrieving fields scoped by reusable field schemas via GraphQL, use <em><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments" target="_blank">inline fragments</a></em> to access the properties of the underlying type. See, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-headless-content#basic-querying">Retrieve headless items</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Ordering in the content item and headless item selectors</strong><br>
The selectors now support a drag-and-drop ordering mechanism for easily reordering linked items, preserving the selected order. Both the minimum and maximum number of selectable items can now also be set. This new feature enables a substantial change in the approach to content modeling, as you can now use <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">reusable content items</a> instead of pages without URLs to model strictly-ordered hierarchies, including <a href="/guides/development/developer-kickstart/model-navigation">website navigation</a>. This new approach helps declutter the website channel content tree and promotes better reusability of your content model.</p>


<p><strong>Content item code name generation API</strong><br>
Developers can now use the <code>CMS.ContentEngine.IContentItemCodeNameProvider</code> API to generate globally unique code names for content items programmatically.</p>


<p><strong>Updated automapping support for reusable field schema</strong><br>
This update introduces the option to specify which model class a given content type referenced under a reusable field schema maps to when using <code>IContentQueryExecutor.GetMappedResult&lt;TModel&gt;</code> or <code>IContentQueryResultMapper.Map</code>.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>

// Maps content types of type 'Laptop.CONTENT_TYPE_NAME' from the collection of items
// referenced by the 'IComputer' schema to the 'Laptop' model class.
[MapContentTypeReferenceTo(Laptop.LAPTOP_CLASS_NAME, typeof(Laptop))]

// Maps content types of type 'Desktop.CONTENT_TYPE_NAME' from the collection of items
// referenced by the 'IComputer' schema to the 'Desktop' model class.
[MapContentTypeReferenceTo(Desktop.DESKTOP_CLASS_NAME, typeof(Desktop))]

// Other content types map to the 'Computer' model class
[MapReferenceTo(typeof(Computer))]

// Property representing reusable field schema references
public IEnumerable&lt;IComputer&gt; Computers { get; set; }

</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>When no mapping preferences are specified, the system defaults first to the type of the property representing the reusable schema and finally to the type registered via <code>RegisterContentTypeMappingAttribute</code>.</p>


<p><strong>Expanded reusable field schema data type support</strong><br>
Fields defined for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schemas</a> can now use the following <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">data types</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content items – content item references (content item <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#combined-content-selector">selector</a>)</li>
<li>Media files – media library files (media file <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#media-file-selector">selector</a>)</li>
<li>Object code names and global identifiers (GUIDs) – references to objects managed by the system (object <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#object-selector">selector</a>)</li>
<li>Pages – web page references (page <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#page-selector">selector</a>)</li>
<li>Taxonomy – a collection of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies">tags</a> that belong to taxonomies (tag <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#tag-selector">selector</a>)</li>
<li>Time interval</li>
<li>Unique identifier (GUID)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Expanded email data type support</strong><br>
Fields defined in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a> for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> can now use the following <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">data types</a>. The data types are also supported by macros in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-templates">email templates</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Media files</li>
<li>Object code names</li>
<li>Object global identifiers</li>
<li>Pages</li>
<li>Time interval</li>
<li>Unique identifier (GUID)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Create pages and folders directly in the content tree</strong><br>
Users can now <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/create-pages">create new pages</a> and folders directly in the content tree of website channel applications.</p>

<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Code generators – Interfaces <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects#reusable-field-schema-interfaces">generated for reusable field schemas</a> now contain the code name of the schema under the <code>REUSABLE_FIELD_SCHEMA_NAME</code> constant.</li>
<li>Content item API
<ul>
<li>Web page content items retrieved via <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api">content item query</a> now contain the identifier of their corresponding <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a> in the <code>WebPageItemWebsiteChannelId</code> property.</li>
<li>Parts of the content item creation API (<code>CreateContentItemParameters</code>, <code>CreateWebPageParameters</code>, and <code>CreateFolderParameters</code>) were extended with additional overloads that no longer require the code name parameters explicitly and instead use <code>IContentItemCodeNameProvider</code> internally to generate one. See the reusable content item page and <a href="/api/">API examples</a> for usage examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="new-object-types-for-cicd-7" data-section="" data-section-ci-cd="">
<h3>New object types for CI/CD</h3>

<p>The update introduces the following object types, which are supported by the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> features. Consider updating the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories">repository.config</a> files of your CI/CD repositories, particularly when using the <code>&lt;IncludedObjectTypes&gt;</code> allowlist for object type filtering.</p>

</section>
<section id="breaking-changes" data-section="" data-section-breaking="">
<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<p><strong>Regular email rescheduling permissions</strong><br>
In order to reschedule the sendout of <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">regular emails</a> in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management">email channel</a> applications, users must now belong to a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">role</a> with the <em>Send email</em> permission for the given application.</p>
<p>Resolution: Add the <em>Send email</em> permission to all <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">roles</a> that need to be able to configure when regular emails are sent.</p>


<p><strong>Content hub URLs</strong><br>
The URLs of administration UI pages for managing individual items in the <em>Content hub</em> application newly include a segment representing the location of the given item. The location value can either be the ID of the folder containing the given item (highlights the folder in the content hub tree) or the all constant (displays the item under “All content items”, is valid for all items).</p>
<p>URL path format: <em>/admin/content-hub/&lt;language&gt;/<strong>&lt;location&gt;</strong>/list/&lt;item ID&gt;/&lt;UI page&gt;</em> Example: <em>/admin/content-hub/en/<strong>all</strong>/list/19/content</em></p>
<p>Resolution: Update any stored or hardcoded URLs targeting content item admin UI pages to include the location segment. Use the <em>all</em> location to preserve full backward compatibility.</p>
<p>If you have any <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface">admin UI customizations</a> that <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages#generate-urls-to-other-administration-pages">generate links</a> to content item UI pages, add the location parameter to your <code>IPageUrlGenerator.GenerateUrl</code> calls (the order of the URL parameters is significant). Use the <code>ContentHubSlugs.ALL_CONTENT_ITEMS</code> constant to generate “All content items” links, which are valid for any content item.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>

// Service obtained using dependency injection
private readonly IPageUrlGenerator pageUrlGenerator;

//...

pageUrlGenerator.GenerateUrl&lt;ContentItemEdit&gt;(languageName, ContentHubSlugs.ALL_CONTENT_ITEMS, contentItemId.ToString());

</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you need to generate links that preserve the currently selected folder when linking within the <em>Content hub</em> application, use the <code>PageParameter</code> attribute to retrieve and bind the folder parameter from the URL.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>

[PageParameter(typeof(StringPageModelBinder), typeof(ContentHubFolder))]
public string FolderId { get; set; }

</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then add the retrieved value to the <code>GenerateUrl</code> parameters in place of the <code>ContentHubSlugs.ALL_CONTENT_ITEMS</code> constant.</p>

</section>
<section id="internal-namespace-api-changes" data-section="" data-section-special="">
<h3>.Internal namespace API changes</h3>

<p>Certain parts of the public API could not safely be used by developers, because they contained members from <code>.Internal namespaces</code>, which are not allowed for public use. These inconsistencies were fixed by moving API members between <code>.Internal</code> and public namespaces, or in certain cases by making members obsolete.</p>
<p>The following list covers impactful changes for public API scenarios – members that were moved from an <code>.Internal</code> namespace to a public one. To resolve potential issues in your code, remove the <em>.Internal</em> suffix from the given namespaces in <code>using</code> statements.</p>

<li><p>AIRA – Content items with custom fields of type <em>Text</em> assigned exclusively via reusable field schemas were unavailable when selecting items as the content source in the <em>Generate with AI</em> dialog for a field using the <a href="/documentation/business-users/aira#generate-email-content">generate email content</a> AI feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Admin UI – The text of some action confirmation messages in the administration was adjusted to be more accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>CI/CD – The Continuous Integration repository didn’t correctly maintain the latest state of content item relationships (references to other content items via the <em>Content items</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">data type</a>) that were edited via the admin UI.

<p><strong>Recommended manual steps for self-hosted environments</strong></p>
<p>Some deployment environments, like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/web/" target="_blank">Azure Web Apps</a>, don’t provide a persistent file system. This can potentially lead to a loss of binary files like <a href="/documentation/business-users/media-libraries">media libraries</a>, <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">content item assets</a>, or files uploaded via the <em>Upload file</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/reference-form-builder-components">form component</a> when redeploying the application, swapping slots, switching servers, etc. The possible loss can be prevented by mapping and storing the files in persistent shared file storage like <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/azure-blob-storage">Azure Blob</a> or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/amazon-s3">Amazon S3</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-private-cloud">self-managed deployments</a> in environments without a persistent file system (e.g., <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/web/" target="_blank">Azure Web Apps</a> )</li>
<li>Don’t have the following folders mapped to shared storage:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>~/assets</strong> folder containing content item assets and media library files</li>
<li>
<strong>~/BizFormFiles</strong> folder containing files uploaded from users using the <em>Upload file</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/reference-form-builder-components">form component</a> (if you use <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder">Forms</a> with the given component)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend taking the following actions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers">mappings</a> for the unmapped folders.</li>
<li>Obtain the files from the unmapped folders in your deployed project and manually upload them to the shared storage. Depending on your deployment environment you might be able to access the files directly on the file system. If this isn’t possible, you can download the files manually (e.g., the files uploaded through forms are stored in each form’s submissions).</li>

<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Taxonomies support</strong></p>
<p><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies">Taxonomies</a> provide users with the option to tag content. Tags can be assigned to individual pieces of content for multiple purposes including but not limited to modeling relationships, categorization, and organization and classification of data. Example uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrators can <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies#configure-taxonomies">create taxonomies</a> and fill them with hierarchically structured tags.</li>
<li>Content editors can add tags to <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/edit-and-publish-pages#add-tags-to-pages">pages</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items#add-tags-to-content-items">reusable content items</a>.</li>
<li>Developers can <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies#retrieve-taxonomies-and-tagged-content">retrieve and display</a> content based on tags.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Query content items without specifying content type names</strong><span id="QueryImprovements-2840"></span></p>
<p>In previous versions of Xperience, retrieving content items via content item query required explicitly stating the content item type as a parameter of the <code>ForContentType</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query#Builder-ForContentType">method</a>. Any implementation that relied on dynamic item selection (e.g., via <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#selectors">selector components</a>) often had to restrict its functionality to a predefined set of content page or resort to various workarounds due to this limitation.</p>
<p>This release extends content item query with options to query content items without prior knowledge of their type. The available parameterization alternatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigned <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">reusable field schemas</a> – selects items from content types with the specified reusable schema assigned. Selection can be further limited using conventional <em>WHERE</em> conditions.</li>
<li>Content item identifiers, GUIDs, or code names (for website pages) – selects items that match the provided collection of identifiers (e.g., via the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">Page selector</a> component).</li>
<li>A list of content types – selects items that match the provided content type names. Doesn’t require repeated <code>ForContentType</code> calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new querying API is available via the <code>ForContentTypes</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query#Builder-ForContentTypes">method</a> on <code>ContentItemQueryBuilder</code>. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query">Reference - Content item query</a> for details.</p>


<p><strong>Enhancements to content item query result mapping</strong></p>
<p>The process of mapping database data returned by content item queries to objects used by the live site was updated to address the requirements introduced by the querying improvements <a href="#QueryImprovements-2840">outlined above</a>.</p>
<p>The existing implementation using <code>IContentQueryExecutor.GetResult&lt;TModel&gt;</code> (<code>GetWebPageResult</code> for pages) requires developers to pattern-match based on content type names and assign appropriate models matching the data. This is especially noticeable when working with result sets comprised of multiple content types:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>
// Mapping a result set containing multiple content types
await contentQueryExecutor.GetResult&lt;IContentItemFieldsSource&gt;(builder, dataContainer =&gt;
{
    // Pattern-matching to suitable model classes
    switch(dataContainer.ContentTypeName)
    {
      case Coffee.CONTENT_TYPE_NAME:
          return contentQueryResultMapper.Map&lt;Coffee&gt;(dataContainer);
      case Event.CONTENT_TYPE_NAME:
          return contentQueryResultMapper.Map&lt;Event&gt;(dataContainer);
      default:
          throw new Exception("Attempting to map an unknown type.");
    }
});
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>While useful for advanced use cases, this approach leads to unnecessary boilerplate code in the majority of common scenarios. It also relies on prior knowledge of content types comprising the result set.</p>
<p>This version update introduces new query execution API – <code>IContentQueryExecutor.GetMappedResult&lt;TModel&gt;</code> (<code>GetMappedWebPageResult</code> for pages). This API abstracts the mapping function present in <code>GetResult&lt;TModel&gt;</code> and directly returns saturated model classes.</p>
<p>For result sets comprised of a single content type, you now omit the mapping function entirely and call:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>
var builder = new ContentItemQueryBuilder();
builder.ForContentType(Article.CONTENT_TYPE_NAME);

// 'GetMappedWebPageResult' directly returns an enumeration of types specified by the generic parameter
IEnumerable&lt;Article&gt; articles =
            await contentQueryExecutor.GetMappedWebPageResult&lt;Article&gt;(builder);
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Result sets that are comprised of two or more content types or that retrieve objects based on <a href="#QueryImprovements-2840">reusable field schemas</a> can also omit all pattern-matching within the mapping logic and work directly with instances of the corresponding model classes:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>
var builder = new ContentItemQueryBuilder();
// Uses the newly introduced API to retrieve multiple content types
builder.ForContentTypes(query =&gt;
{
    query.OfContentType(Article.CONTENT_TYPE_NAME, Blog.CONTENT_TYPE_NAME);
    query.WithContentTypeFields();
});

// Gets a mixed collection of articles and blogs.
// The 'TModel' generic in GetMappedWebPageResult must cast the result set to a type shared by all models.
// This example uses 'IContentItemFieldsSource' - implemented by all generated model classes - as the shared type.
IEnumerable&lt;IContentItemFieldsSource&gt; result =
        await executor.GetMappedWebPageResult&lt;IContentItemFieldsSource&gt;(builder);

// Gets all articles
List&lt;Article&gt; articles = result.OfType&lt;Article&gt;().ToList();
// Gets all blogs
List&lt;Blog&gt; blogs = result.OfType&lt;Blog&gt;().ToList();
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The system determines which model class to instantiate for each content type based on the <code>RegisterContentTypeMapping</code> attribute used to annotate model classes. The attribute is, by default, present in all <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects">generated classes</a>. Each content type can be associated with exactly one model class via the attribute. To use the <code>GetMappedResult</code> methods in existing projects, <strong>regenerate all model classes</strong> to ensure the attribute is present in all models.</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of these changes, <code>IContentQueryResultMapper</code> and <code>IWebPageQueryResultMapper</code>, used by the mapping logic within <code>GetResult&lt;TModel&gt;</code>, were unified to offer identical functionality for all content item types (reusable, pages). Going forward, we recommend using <code>IContentQueryResultMapper</code> for all custom mapping operations. Related scenarios covered in the documentation were updated to reflect the new recommendation.</p>


<p><strong>UI form components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can now provide multiple dependency fields to a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/editing-components/configure-editing-component-state">form component configurator</a>, enabling you to create more complex rules and conditions for your editing components. For example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>
  [FormComponentConfiguration(typeof(MyConfigurator),
                              new[] { nameof(FirstDependencyField),
                                      nameof(SecondDependencyField) })]
  </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers can now access the <code>ContentTypeID</code> and <code>IsSecured</code> properties in <code>IWebPagePanelItemModifier</code> implementations, making it possible to disable pages in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components#page-selector">Page selector</a> form component based on their <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content type</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/secure-pages">access privileges</a>. For example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>
  public class SecuredArticlePagesPanelItemModifier : IWebPagePanelItemModifier
  {
      public WebPagePanelItem Modify(WebPagePanelItem pagePanelItem, WebPagePanelItemModifierParameters itemModifierParams)
      {
          string contentTypeCodeName = DataClassInfoProvider.GetClassName(itemModifierParams.WebPageMetadata.ContentTypeID);

          // Disables selection of secured pages of the 'acme.article' type
          if (string.Equals(contentTypeCodeName, "acme.article", System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) &amp;&amp; itemModifierParams.WebPageMetadata.IsSecured)
          {
              pagePanelItem.SelectableOption.Selectable = false;
              pagePanelItem.SelectableOption.UnselectableReason = "Cannot select secured 'acme.article' pages";
          }

          return pagePanelItem;
      }
  }
  </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>version 28.3.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-16" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p>Workflow</p>
<ul>
<li>New workflow feature that allows you to define the lifecycle for <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">pages</a>, <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">reusable content items</a>, <a href="/documentation/business-users/headless-content">headless items</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a>. Each workflow consists of one or more custom steps between the default <em>Draft</em> and <em>Published</em> steps. This helps ensure the quality of content by setting up a reviewing and approval process tailored specifically for your organization. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/workflows">Workflows</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Artificial intelligence</p>
<ul>
<li>New <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/aira-configuration">AI feature</a> for fields using the <em>Rich text editor</em> form component, which allows users to refine selected pieces of text (make text shorter, improve spelling and grammar, etc.).</li>
</ul>


<p>Image file endpoint protection</p>
<ul>
<li>New feature that allows improved protection of the media library image file endpoint (<code>getmedia</code>) for requests with resize parameters. When this feature is enabled, a validation hash is required for any image file requests with resize query string parameters. This feature is enabled for new installations by default. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/media-library-configuration#image-file-request-protection">Image file request protection</a> for more information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Note</strong>: If image endpoint protection is enabled for an existing project updated from a previous version, you need to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/media-library-configuration#enable-image-file-request-protection-on-existing-projects">update certain media file URLs in your content</a> to ensure that the content is displayed correctly.</li>
</ul>


<p>Integrations</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure AI Search – An external module that enables you to create <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search" target="_blank">Azure AI Search</a> indexes for the content of <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">pages</a> from a website channel’s content tree using a code-first approach. The module is distributed as a NuGet package. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-azure-ai-search" target="_blank">Xperience by Kentico Azure Search</a> GitHub repository.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed issues – security</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt/6.31.0" target="_blank">System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt</a> package (transitive dependency) was updated to the latest version.</p>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-16" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Admin UI – The tile view of the applications list in the administration displayed an incorrect number of applications per row.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact management – The <em>Email bounces</em> column in contact listings incorrectly displayed “OK” for contacts without a known email address. After the updated, a dash is displayed instead for such contacts.</p></li>
<li><p>Content items – All public methods of <code>IContentItemManager</code>, except for <code>GetContentItemMetadata</code> and <code>GetContentItemLanguageMetadata</code>, now check that the content item identifier provided as input refers to a reusable content item. The purpose of <code>IContentItemManager</code> is to facilitate manipulation with reusable content items. The fact that it allowed users to work with other types of content items was an oversight that could lead to data inconsistencies. To work with web page items, use <code>IWebPageManager</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Headless tracking – If a new <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities/custom-activities">custom activity type</a> was created or an existing type’s code name was changed, the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/headless-tracking">headless tracking API</a> didn’t reflect the change until the application’s cache was cleared.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules – Attempting to create new fields without database columns in UI forms without first specifying their data type resulted in an unhandled exception instead of failed form validation.</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – The scroll bar was not available in the Page selector editing component when used in widget properties if the page selected as root had a large number of subpages.</p></li>
<li><p>SaaS environment – In certain rare cases, the Cloudflare CDN firewall blocked the upload of media library files.</p></li>
<li><p>UI form components – The <em>Object code names selector</em> component incorrectly allowed users to specify object types without a dedicated code name column.</p></li>

<h3>Hotfix (February 15, 2024)</h3>
<p><strong>version 28.2.3</strong></p>

<p>Fixed issues – security</p>
<div data-entry="" data-entry-security-issue="">
<p>The hotfix updates the ‘Microsoft.Data.SqlClient’ library to version 5.1.5.</p>
</div>


<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span data-entry data-entry-issue>Admin UI authentication – The <code>ExpireTimeSpan</code> property of <code>AdminIdentityOptions.AuthenticationOptions</code> was not being reflected when set via the <code>AdminIdentityOptions</code> object. For example:</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>
  builder.Services.Configure&lt;AdminIdentityOptions&gt;(builder.Configuration.GetSection(nameof(AdminIdentityOptions)));

      "Authenticationoptions": {
          "ExpireTimeSpan": "06:00:00"
      }
  }
  </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Instead, the property was only configurable via its encapsulating <code>AdminAuthenticationOptions</code> type. The hotfix ensures correct behavior and also logs a warning to the event log if it detects that the <code>ExpireTimeSpan</code> value is being set via <code>AdminAuthenticationOptions</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">CI/CD – An error occurred when restoring a CI/CD repository of a project with a different default language than English into a database different than the one from which the repository was stored.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Code generators – Since version 28.2.0, generating provider classes and interfaces for object types via the code generator utility was not possible.

<h3>Hotfix (February 1, 2024)</h3>
<p><strong>version 28.2.1</strong></p>

<p>New features</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-entry="" data-entry-feature="">UI form components – You can now deploy your projects <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-private-cloud/deploy-without-the-administration">without the Xperience by Kentico administration</a> when you make use of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/editing-components/configure-editing-component-state">form component configurators</a>. This is now possible after registering each form component configurator under an identifier via the <code>RegisterFormComponentConfigurator</code> assembly attribute, and then using the <code>FormComponentConfiguration</code> attribute with its new <code>Identifier</code> property.</span></li>

This led to duplicate key errors during subsequent CI/CD restore operations, as the synchronized URLs had non-matching GUIDs. The hotfix only prevents the GUID inconsistencies when updating project databases to version 28.2.1 or newer (the issue is not resolved for projects where the inconsistencies are already present).</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Content types – When adding reusable field schemas in the <em>Content types</em> application, the checkbox in the side panel did not toggle to display a checkmark - indicating successful selection of a schema for addition - unless the checkbox element was selected directly.

<p><strong>version 28.2.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-17" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p>Reusable field schemas</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusable field schemas enable the reuse of a collection of content type fields across multiple content types. A common use case is grouping a set of functionally related fields that often need to be duplicated across content types. For example, for search engine optimization purposes or social networking. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/reusable-field-schemas">Reusable field schemas</a>.</li>
<li>Reusable field schemas also introduce a new type of code file primitive – reusable schema interfaces. Each interface encapsulates fields defined by its corresponding schema. The code generator now supports generating these files via the <code>--type</code> <code>ReusableFieldSchemas</code> parameter. Generated content type classes implement these interfaces as needed based on the set of assigned reusable field schemas. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects#reusable-field-schema-interfaces">Generate code files for system objects</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Headless content preview</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s now possible to retrieve headless items in their latest available version when using an <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management">API key</a> with the appropriate Access type.
<ul>
<li>Your existing API keys will be automatically converted to the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management#access-types-of-api-keys">Headless content - Published</a> Access type upon applying the update.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After setting up the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management">Preview URL</a>, you can now easily navigate to your preview environment straight from a headless channel application using the <a href="/documentation/business-users/headless-content">Preview button</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Headless tracking</p>
<ul>
<li>Headless tracking enables developers to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/contact-configuration">track contacts</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities">log activities</a> for the audience of external content channels, such as mobile apps, single-page applications, etc. Xperience then serves as a central hub where you can monitor contacts and analyze activities for all connected websites and channels. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/headless-tracking">Headless tracking</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Website development</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>RoutedWebPage</code> type was extended by new properties containing further information about the language, content type and website channel of the currently accessed page. Developers can use this data to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-page-content">retrieve the page</a> and access its content fields. For example, when developing <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/widgets-for-page-builder">widgets</a> or other <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> components, the <code>RoutedWebPage</code> <code>ComponentViewModel.Page</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Content management</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Content hub</em> application now supports bulk deletion of content items. Select the set of content items to delete via selectors on the left-hand side of the listing.</li>
<li>Image thumbnails displayed in the user interface (e.g., in asset selector, content hub) now have a chessboard pattern as a background to improve the visibility of white images with a transparent background.</li>
</ul>


<p>Emails</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">Regular emails</a> sent to subscribed recipients now support one-click unsubscribe. The system automatically includes the <code>List-Unsubscribe-Post</code> and <code>List-Unsubscribe</code> headers in regular emails. If a recipient uses one-click unsubscribe, the resulting request is handled in the same way as a standard unsubscribe link in email content.</li>
</ul>


<p>Admin UI customization</p>
<ul>
<li>UI listing pages – <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/reference-ui-page-templates/listing-ui-page-template">Listing UI pages</a> can now be extended with commands that apply to multiple items from the listing via the <code>PageConfiguration.MassActions</code> property.</li>
</ul>


<p>File system providers</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Amazon S3 – New configuration option that controls whether <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/amazon-s3">Amazon S3</a> file system mappings fall back to the original local folder if a requested file cannot be found in Amazon S3. This fallback can cause issues when deploying files using the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> restore process, for example during <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment">deployment to the SaaS environment</a>. Developers can configure the option using the introduced <code>EnableFallbackToLocalFileSystem</code> property of <code>AmazonStorageOptions</code>. The default values are <em>true</em> for self-managed projects and <em>false</em> for SaaS deployments.</p>

</ul>


<p>Integrations</p>
<ul>
<li>CRM – An external module (a starter kit) that simplifies the integration of Xperience by Kentico with CRM software. The module also contains two packages that directly integrate Xperience by Kentico with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/sales" target="_blank">Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales</a> and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/eu/products/sales-cloud/" target="_blank">Salesforce Sales Cloud</a> CRM. The integration enables sending form submissions from Xperience to the CRM as leads and checking synchronization status in the Xperience administration. The starter kit and two integrations are distributed as NuGet packages. See the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-crm" target="_blank">Xperience by Kentico CRM</a> GitHub repository for details.</li>
<li>Tag Manager – An external module that allows marketers and editors to author and embed custom tags or code snippets into website channels. The module supports Google Tag Manager code snippets out of the box. The module is distributed as a NuGet package. See the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-tag-manager" target="_blank">Xperience by Kentico Tag Manager</a> GitHub repository for details.</li>
</ul>

<section id="updates-and-changes-15" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p>Code generators</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>--type All</code> parameter used to generate code files for all supported objects in the system is now marked obsolete. Running the code generator utility with this parameter produces a warning in the output. The parameter’s behavior remains unchanged. However, it doesn’t support generation for reusable fields schemas introduced in this release and will output invalid code in projects that make use of this new feature. Use a combination of the existing parameters to generate equivalent output.</li>
<li>Code generators now provide the option to generate object type (module class) code files without the corresponding <em>I*Provider</em> and <em>*Provider</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api">classes</a> via the <code>--with-provider-class</code> class parameter. The parameter defaults to <em>true</em> – if not provided, object type classes are generated with their corresponding providers. If set to <em>false</em>, only the <em>*Info</em> class is generated. This option was added to support the use of the generic <code>IInfoProvider&lt;TInfo&gt;</code> provider class instead of dedicated providers per object type. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api#info-class-managers">Info class managers</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Data types</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Date</em> and <em>Long integer number</em> data types are now available for the fields of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a> for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Headless channels</p>
<ul>
<li>Domains that are allowed for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by headless channel GraphQL endpoints can now be configured in the administration using the new <em>Settings &gt; Content &gt; Headless &gt; Allowed origins</em> setting. This setting overrides allowed domains set through the <em>CMSHeadless.CorsAllowedOrigins</em> key in your application’s configuration file (<em>appsettings.json</em> by default) or the <em>HeadlessOptions.CorsAllowedOrigins</em> option in your project’s startup file (<em>Program.cs</em>). See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-headless-content">Retrieve headless content</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Page Builder</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Vue.js</em> framework used in the Page and Form Builders was updated to <a href="https://v2.vuejs.org/lts/" target="_blank">version 3</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Xperience Portal</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>DNS record configuration</em> of custom channel domains in Xperience Portal now supports IPv6 AAAA records for apex domains.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>In certain rare cases, the system could incorrectly display a confirmation dialog when selecting actions in listing pages that did not have a confirmation dialog defined.</li>
<li>The dialog for a new language variant added in the content hub was missing a caption and description.</li>
<li>The header of action columns in listing pages was missing the background. As a result, listing headers overlapped with the <em>Actions</em> text.</li>
<li>When using the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/reference-ui-page-templates/binding-ui-page-template">binding UI page template</a>, the confirmation dialog for removing items from the binding was hidden behind the editing side panel in some cases. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Content hub – The <em>Properties → Information → Published</em> status was displayed incorrectly for published content items. The issue occurred on versions 28.1.0 and newer.</p></li>
<li><p>Content item API – The behavior of column data retrieval via the <code>GetValue</code> and <code>TryGetValue</code> methods was unified for nullable and non-nullable types. If the methods do not find the requested column, they return the specified default value instead. Prior to this version, the methods returned <code>null</code> for nullable types and raised a <code>NullReferenceException</code> for non-nullable types. Developers could encounter this behavior when manually mapping the result of content item queries from <code>IContentQueryDataContainer</code> objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Forms – Calling <code>BizFormItemProvider.GetItem</code> terminated with a database exception for any combination of parameters. As a result, it was not possible to, for example, preview submitted form data via the <em>Forms</em> application. This issue was introduced in version 28.1.1.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Headless API</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the error messages returned for various invalid states in GraphQL queries for <a href="https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-headless-content">retrieving headless channel content</a>.</li>
<li>Null values were not accepted as valid for optional arguments of GraphQL query fields in headless content retrieval requests.</li>
<li>When retrieving linked headless items via GraphQL, the items were retrieved in a different order than they were displayed in the <em>Headless item selector</em>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Headless items – Improved UI texts and tooltips in the Headless item selector.</p></li>
<li><p>Media libraries – The error message displayed when attempting to upload files with non-allowed extensions to <a href="/documentation/business-users/media-libraries">media libraries</a> was updated to contain accurate information.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules – An error occurred when attempting to delete a category in the field editor of a module class UI form. For example, the problem could occur when editing a UI form of a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types/extend-system-object-types">customizable system class</a> in the <em>Modules</em> application.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Page Builder</p>
<ul>
<li>The system did not serve the minified ‘systemFormComponents.min.js’ file correctly in the Page Builder scripts for the Form widget.</li>
<li>The widget and section selection dialog in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/widgets-and-page-builder">Page Builder</a> interface was displayed incorrectly in certain cases. After applying the update, the dialog dimensions and layout are better modified to match the screen dimensions and the number of displayed items. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page templates</p>
<ul>
<li>The Microsoft Application Insights client-side telemetry script was re-added to the Dancing Goat project template (<em>kentico-xperience-sample-mvc</em>) after being accidentally removed in version 27.0.0.</li>
<li>When implementing <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/page-templates-for-page-builder">page templates</a> with a custom model, it was not possible to pass data to the template view using ViewBag, ViewData or TempData. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages</p>
<ul>
<li>After collapsing and subsequently expanding the URL section on the Content tab with an empty URL slug field, the UI did not display the validation error message.</li>
<li>After discarding changes made on the Content tab, the headers of form categories would disappear.</li>
<li>The URL section on the Content tab was incorrectly expanded by default on existing pages. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reusable content – When a content item was linked from two different fields of another content item and the user attempted to remove the reference from one of the fields, the system did not correctly remove the reference, leaving the item linked in both fields.</p></li>
<li><p>SaaS environment – An error occurred when accessing the root of a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments">SaaS environment</a> domain that didn’t have a valid website channel running (e.g., a website channel domain before package deployment or a custom email channel service domain). Now the system displays an appropriate message without any errors.</p></li>
<li><p>UI form components – Expendable form categories containing fields with dependencies unexpectedly collapsed after such fields were changed.</p></li>

<h2>Refresh (December 14, 2023)</h2>
<p><strong>version 28.1.0</strong></p>

<div data-entry="" data-entry-special="">
<p>You can read a <a href="https://community.kentico.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-refresh-december-14-2023" target="_blank">blog post by Sean Wright</a> for a brief introduction of this refresh.</p>
</div>

<section id="new-features-18" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p>Headless channels</p>
<ul>
<li>This release introduces a production-ready version of the headless API feature. With <em>headless channels</em>, you can now securely retrieve content using HTTP requests and GraphQL, and consolidate your applications, services or external websites into the Xperience ecosystem.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/headless-channel-management">Headless channel management</a> describes how to set up and configure headless channels.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/headless-content">Headless content</a> explains how to prepare and edit the content available for headless channels.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-headless-content">Retrieve headless content</a> is a developer resource dedicated to retrieving Xperience content using GraphQL.</li>
</ul>


<p>Content management</p>
<ul>
<li>Cascade publishing – When publishing a page, content item, email or headless item that links to other <em>reusable</em> content items, the system now displays a list of all unpublished linked items. Users can select individual linked items and publish them together with the main item. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">Content hub</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>


<p>Code generators</p>
<ul>
<li>Code files generated for reusable content types now implement the <code>IContentItemFieldsSource</code> interface. The interface can be used as the unifying type to access system fields from a collection of multiple content types, or register extension methods that are available for all generated classes. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects">Generate code files for system objects</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Emails</p>
<ul>
<li>Email templates – Added support for displaying links to pages referenced via <em>Pages</em> content item fields within email templates. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-templates">Email templates</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>


<p>SaaS environment</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Level 1 project tier is now available for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments">Xperience Portal projects</a>. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/saas-service-plans">SaaS service plans</a> for more information about the available project tiers.</li>
<li>When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment/manage-saas-deployments">downloading a backup</a> of an application’s storage and files, you can now access and download the backup via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10" target="_blank">AzCopy</a> or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer" target="_blank">Azure Storage Explorer</a> tools instead of downloading a possibly very large zip file.</li>
<li>Support for the following SaaS deployment regions was added: Germany West Central, Japan East, UAE North, Canada Central, North Europe (Ireland) and East Asia (Hong Kong).</li>
<li>Xperience Portal now displays the version of the Xperience application for all deployments.</li>
</ul>


<p>API</p>
<ul>
<li>Content item query – A new <code>IncludeTotalCount</code> parametrization method for content item query was added. The method ensures that every retrieved item stores the total number of items, regardless of pagination applied by the <code>Offset</code> method. The total count can be accessed by calling <code>GetTotalCount()</code> on any item retrieved by the query. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/reference-content-item-query">Reference - Content item query</a>.</li>
<li>A new interface <code>IWebPageFolderRetriever</code> was added to allow developers to retrieve folders from the content tree of website channels.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="updates-and-changes-16" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Content types – A content type that is allowed in a channel can no longer be removed from the channel if any content items of that type already exist under the channel. Also, when updating to this version, all missing relationships between content types and channels are automatically added.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="updated-best-practises" data-section="" data-section-special="">
<h3>Updated best practises</h3>

<ul>
<li>When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">registering custom data types</a> into the system, call the registration code <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/run-code-on-application-startup">during application startup</a> in the <code>OnPreInit</code> method of a module class. This ensures that your data types are available in all situations.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-18" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Select all</em> checkbox could behave incorrectly under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>The media library and page selector side panels used incorrect scrolling behavior in certain cases. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Admin UI customization – The support for admin JS module development over HTTPS that was introduced in version 28.0.0 did not work with the default ASP.NET Core development certificate due to a misconfiguration.</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – Pages in Page Builder and Preview mode whose language was retrieved using the <code>IContentLanguageRetriever</code> interface were in the fallback language instead of the preferred language if fallbacks were applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Project templates – In the <em>Dancing Goat</em> project template the Page builder displayed wrong language variant for linked items when a language fallback was applied.</p></li>

<li>The <em>Object global identifiers</em> data type, available for custom object types (in custom modules) and system classes since version 27.0.0, is now also available when modeling web page and reusable content types. Note that the system doesn’t maintain the referential integrity of objects linked via this data type. Custom code must account for the referenced objects no longer existing or being otherwise invalid. </li>

<h2>Refresh (November 16, 2023)</h2>
<p><strong>version 28.0.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-19" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>.NET 8 support – Xperience by Kentico version 28.0.0 fully supports project development on <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0" target="_blank">.NET 8</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Languages</p>
<ul>
<li>When creating a new language variant of a <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/translate-pages">page</a> or <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items">content item</a>, it is now possible to copy content from an existing language variant.</li>
</ul>


<p>Page templates</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Preset</em> <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/page-templates">page template</a> feature was restored. Preset templates allow content editors to save the Page Builder configuration and content of existing pages that are based on a template. The resulting templates can then be used as a starting point for new pages.</li>
<li>
<code>TemplateViewModel</code> and <code>TemplateViewModel&lt;TPropertiesType&gt;</code> classes were introduced to allow developers to pass a custom model to the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/page-templates-for-page-builder">page template’s view</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Emails</p>
<ul>
<li>Email templates – The content types for which an <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-templates">email template</a> is allowed can now be configured directly when editing individual templates in the <em>Email templates</em> application.</li>
</ul>


<p>Website development</p>
<ul>
<li>When accessing the current page in various website development scenarios, the API now provides <code>RoutedWebPage</code> objects, which contain the code name of the page’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content type</a> in addition to the page ID and language. Developers can use this data to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-page-content">retrieve the page</a> and access its content fields. For example, when developing <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/widgets-for-page-builder">widgets</a> or other <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a> components, the <code>RoutedWebPage</code> data for the current page is accessible in <code>ComponentViewModel.Page</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Rich text editor</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to manually extend the set of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/rich-text-editor-configuration">allowed HTML attributes and tags</a> in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">Rich text editor</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Customization</p>
<ul>
<li>Module classes now support service resolution via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iserviceprovider" target="_blank">IServiceProvider</a> in initialization code, using the new <code>OnInit(ModuleInitParameters)</code> override. Additionally, the <code>OnPreInit(ModuleInitParameters)</code> override allows access to the application’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.iservicecollection" target="_blank">IServiceCollection</a>, e.g., to configure the application’s startup options. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/run-code-on-application-startup">Run code on application startup</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Content modeling</p>
<ul>
<li>This release changes the accessibility of the <em>Pages</em> and <em>Object code names</em> data types.
<ul>
<li>Pages – this data type is now available when modeling web page and reusable <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a>, and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">object types</a> (in custom modules). Fields of this data type store references to web pages.</li>
<li>Object code names – this data type is now available when modeling web page and reusable <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a> , custom <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">object types</a> (in custom modules) and when <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types/extend-system-object-types">extending system object types</a>. Fields of this data type store references to other objects in system via object code names.Note that the system doesn’t maintain the referential integrity of objects linked via these data types. Custom code must account for the referenced objects no longer existing or being otherwise invalid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Admin UI authentication</p>
<ul>
<li>New <code>ExpireTimespan</code> property for <code>AdminAuthenticationOptions</code> that allows you to set the expiration period for authenticated admin UI sessions. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/administration-registration-and-authentication/administration-forms-authentication">Administration - Forms authentication</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Admin UI customization</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom JavaScript modules can now be developed in SSL-enabled environments when using the <em>Proxy</em> mode. To enable SSL, add the <code>UseSSL</code> property to the module configuration in your Xperience instance. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/prepare-your-environment-for-admin-development">Prepare your environment for admin development</a>.</li>
</ul>

<section id="breaking-changes-api-1" data-section="" data-section-breaking-api="">
<h3>Breaking changes – API</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>ITreeNode</code> interface was removed. The interface was not functionally connected to any system logic. It was an accidental remainder from the switch to the new content modeling approach introduced by version 27.0.0.</li>
<li>The <code>IPageBuilderConfigurationSourceLoader</code> and <code>PageBuilderConfigurationSource</code> types were moved to the <code>Kentico.PageBuilder.Web.Mvc.Internal</code> namespace and are not intended for public use.</li>

<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>AIRA – <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/aira-configuration">Email subject suggestions</a> generated by the AI feature were in some cases displayed in a different language than the one set for the email channel after requesting adjustments via the quick refinement buttons or the manual text prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Activities – If a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities/custom-activities">custom activity</a> was logged from client-side code directly on page load, two separate anonymous contacts were created for new visitors (one with the custom activity, the other with the system’s default page visit activities). To fix the issue, developers need to register updated activity logging scripts using the new <code>ActivityLoggingScriptV2</code> extension method.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Some object creation pages in the administration UI had missing page titles.</li>
<li>The “select all” checkbox above selectable lists of items in the administration UI behaved incorrectly in cases where the list contained both selected and not selected items. After the fix, the checkbox either selects all items if none are currently selected, or clears the selection of all items.</li>
<li>The text of object “name” field labels was unified throughout the administration to match the “Object name” and “Code name” format. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>CI/CD – Content item references were not restored properly in the CD <em>Create</em> mode, leaving the database inconsistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Channels – Validation for the maximum number of allowed characters was missing for the domain inputs offered when creating or editing channels.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact management – The <em>Birthday</em> and <em>Country</em>/<em>State</em> fields are now displayed when editing a contact’s profile in the <em>Contact management</em> application.</p></li>
<li><p>Content item API – When fields of the <em>Content item asset</em> data type did not have <em>Required</em> set and were left unpopulated, retrieving content items with such fields resulted in an exception. After the update, the retrieval API correctly returns null.</p></li>
<li><p>Content types – In certain rare cases when creating content types, the system could return an error if the code name of the newly created content type matched the database table name of an already existing, previously renamed content type.</p></li>
<li><p>Email templates – Leading and trailing whitespace characters in the names of email templates weren’t trimmed correctly in certain parts of the administration UI.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Emails</p>
<ul>
<li>If a contact belonged to a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">recipient list</a> and their email address was later deleted, an error occurred for each such contact when sending a <em>Regular</em> email to the recipient list. After the fix, contacts without an email address are skipped when sending emails, without causing any errors.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">Subscription</a> confirmation and unsubscription links didn’t work if the recipient’s email address contained certain special characters (for example ’’). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forms</p>
<ul>
<li>The default <em>From</em> address of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/custom-form-autoresponder-emails">custom form autoresponder emails</a> didn’t reflect the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration">global sending domain for system emails</a> set via <code>SystemEmailOptions.SendingDomain</code>.</li>
<li>When a file was uploaded through a form’s <em>Upload file</em> field, a 404 error was returned when attempting to view or download the file in the <em>Submissions</em> view of the <em>Forms</em> application. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>General – The application could reach the preset limit on the number of database connections under heavy traffic (e.g., during a load test).</p></li>
<li><p>Media libraries – An error occurred in certain cases when renaming a folder in a media library in the <em>Media libraries</em> application.</p></li>
<li><p>Pages – The <em>Current URL</em> or <em>New URL</em> fields displayed an incorrect URL value when creating a new language variant of a page that already existed in the fallback language.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Pages</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample sites based on the <em>Dancing Goat</em> project template didn’t preserve the currently selected language when redirecting users after sign-in, registration or sign-out. The English variant of the site’s home page was always opened. The issue is only resolved for new projects created after <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects">updating project templates</a>.</li>
<li>The <em>Current URL</em> or <em>New URL</em> fields displayed an incorrect URL value when creating a new language variant of a page that already existed in the fallback language. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Project templates – Certain sample widgets included in the <em>Dancing Goat</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation">project template</a> contained cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Rich text editor – Images or links added in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a> weren’t created correctly if the selected content item asset contained an apostrophe ( ’ ) in its file name. This could result in missing images or broken links on the live site or in sent emails.</p></li>

<h2>Refresh (October 12, 2023)</h2>
<p><strong>version 27.0.0</strong></p>

<div data-entry="" data-entry-special="">
<p>This Refresh release introduces major changes to content management and general content workflow in the system.</p>
<p><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects">Updating</a> is only supported for projects on version 26.6 (any hotfix version). If you are transitioning from an older version, you need to perform the update twice – first to version 26.6.0 and then to 27.0.0 or newer.</p>
</div>
<section id="content-management-changes" data-entry="" data-entry-special="">
<h3>Content management changes</h3>
<p>This release replaces the primary method of content composition and delivery – driven by pages (<code>TreeNode</code> objects), the <em>Pages</em> application, and the <code>DocumentQuery</code> content delivery API – with the concept of <strong>reusable</strong> and <strong>non-reusable</strong> content items and <strong>channels</strong>. The concept of first creating a content type template and defining custom fields via the field editor remains unchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Reusable content items</strong> encapsulate pieces of <em>structured data</em> – pure content not burdened by any information specific to a content delivery method, such as additional formatting metadata. Reusable items represent content intended for use across multiple delivery methods. Individual reusable items can also reference other reusable items, up to an arbitrary depth, to create complex, multi-level structures.</p>
<p><strong>Non-reusable content items</strong> consume reusable content items via reference and serve as the medium for delivery. Each non-reusable item is responsible for transforming the referenced reusable content by providing delivery-specific formatting and metadata. Non-reusable items are tightly coupled to <em>channels.</em></p>
<p><strong>Channels</strong> represent a medium through which information is delivered from the system to end-users. This release introduces two types of channels: <em>Email</em> and <em>Website.</em></p>
<p><strong>Email</strong> channels are a dedicated medium of communication to a specific audience. Each project may contain multiple email channels, focusing on different content strategies, languages and audience engagement techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Website</strong> channels encapsulate websites managed by Xperience. Each channel is an independent entity with its own domain name configuration and content management. Channels store content in pages and linked content items.</p>
<p>With this release, there is no longer a single <em>Pages</em> application to encapsulate the majority of content management functionality. Instead, each existing channel has a dedicated application, which can be found under the <em>Channels</em> category in the Xperience administration.</p>
<p>See the following pages for a detailed introduction to the new functionality:</p>

<section id="channels-instead-of-sites" data-entry="" data-entry-special="">
<h3>Channels instead of Sites</h3>
<p>With the introduction of channels, the concept of grouping project-related data under a site (<code>SiteInfo</code> object) and the existence of site-specific objects was also removed. This should not pose a problem for existing projects, since previous Xperience by Kentico versions only supported a single site.</p>

<h3>New features</h3>
<section id="content-management" data-entry="" data-entry-feature="">
<h4>Content management</h4>
<ul>
<li>Languages – Multilingual support for pages and content items was introduced. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">Languages</a>.</li>
<li>Support for running multiple websites managed by a single Xperience back-end. Documentation will be available soon.</li>
<li>Page templates – When registering <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/page-templates-for-page-builder">Page templates for Page Builder</a>, developers can now specify the content types for which the template is available without needing to implement template filtering (new <code>ContentTypeNames</code> property of the <code>RegisterPageTemplate</code> attribute).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="emails" data-entry="" data-entry-feature="">
<h4>Emails</h4>
<ul>
<li>Email channels – Emails in Xperience are now created and managed within <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management">email channels</a>. Channels allow for clean separation of an organization’s emails, each focusing on a different content strategy or language. Every email channel has a unique <em>sending domain</em>, and its own application in the Xperience administration where users <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">create and send emails</a>.</li>
<li>Email content – The system now uses <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a> to define the fields available to marketers when creating emails. Email content types are tied with <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-templates">email templates</a>, which contain macro placeholders that set the position of individual fields within the email content.</li>
<li>Email workflow – Emails with the <em>Form autoresponder</em> or <em>Confirmation</em> purpose now support basic Draft/Published workflow. This allows users to edit a new version of an email while the system still uses the previous published version. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">Emails</a>.</li>
<li>AI integration – Added an integration with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview" target="_blank">Azure OpenAI Service</a>, which allows users to generate content suggestions for email subjects and content fields. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/aira-configuration">Artificial intelligence features</a>.</li>
<li>Email client configuration – The default SMTP and SendGrid email clients can now be configured separately for individual email channels, as well as system emails that are not related to a specific channel. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration">Email configuration</a>.</li>
<li>Bounced email configuration – The bounced email tracking configuration for SMTP email clients can now be configured separately for individual email channels, as well as system emails. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-email-tracking">Set up email tracking</a>.</li>
<li>You can now set a shared sending domain for all system emails that are not created under a specific email channel (e.g., user registration, password reset, system notification emails). Use the <code>SystemEmailOptions</code> options class. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration">Email configuration</a>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="data-protection" data-entry="" data-entry-feature="">
<h4>Data protection</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Assets</p>
<ul>
<li>Subfolders under the <em>/assets</em> folder for storing <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">content item assets</a> and media files are now always created with lower case names.</li>
<li>The file system folder structure for <a href="/documentation/business-users/media-libraries/manage-media-files">media library files</a> no longer includes a folder matching the site code name (media libraries are now global). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content types – Content type features are not available and were replaced with the <em>Use for</em> selector on the <em>General</em> tab.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <em>Pages</em> for content types meant for website channels.</li>
<li>Select <em>Reusable content</em> for content types in the <em>Content hub</em>.</li>
<li>Select <em>Emails</em> for content types meant for email channels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cookies – <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/cookies">Default cookie level</a> configuration is now tied to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channels</a> and must be configured on each channel’s <em>Channel settings</em> tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Event log – The “Error notification email address” (<em>CMSSendErrorNotificationTo</em>) and “Send email notifications from” (<em>CMSSendEmailNotificationsFrom</em>) settings – used to configure the sending of notification emails about events logged into the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/event-log">event log</a> – have been removed. The system by default no longer sends any notification emails related to the event log. If you wish to implement a similar functionality, use <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/event-log/customize-event-logging#implement-event-log-writers">event log writers</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Forms</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>After form submission</em> <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms">settings</a> of forms (<em>Display a message</em>, <em>Redirect to URL</em>, <em>Redirect to page</em>) were moved from the form editing UI to properties of individual <em>Form</em> widgets. The <em>Autoresponder</em> settings remain in the form UI.</li>
<li>The reCAPTCHA form component no longer controls which reCAPTCHA version is displayed to the user. Instead, it uses the reCAPTCHA version configured by the website channel under which it is displayed.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">Forms</a> are now global objects (not related to a specific <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channel</a>). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Modules – It was possible to edit certain properties of fields in the UI forms of system modules and then delete the fields. Such changes could cause errors and inconsistencies in the administration.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Page Builder – Page Builder is no longer enabled via the content type <em>Features</em> tab. Instead, you must specify a collection of content type code names when enabling Page Builder for the project in the startup pipeline.</p>

<h3>Breaking changes – API</h3>

<p>The following list covers breaking changes in frequently used API scenarios, but is not a comprehensive list of all API changes.</p>
<ul>

<li>Use <code>IWebPageManager</code> to manipulate pages instead of <code>TreeNode</code> methods.</li>
<li>The <code>IPageDataContextRetriever</code> service was replaced with the <code>IWebPageDataContextRetriever</code> and the returned object has changed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval">Content retrieval</a>
<ul>
<li>
<code>DocumentQuery</code> and the <code>IPageRetriever</code> interface were removed, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-page-content">Retrieve page content</a>.</li>

</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities">Activities</a>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross-site tracking
<ul>
<li>When configuring the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/cross-site-tracking">cross-site tracking</a> feature for the application, the <code>ConsentSettings</code> property of <code>CrossSiteTrackingOptions</code> now accepts an <code>IEnumerable</code> collection of <code>CrossSiteTrackingConsentOptions</code> objects instead of a single object. Add one object for every website channel where you wish to use the feature.</li>
<li>The <code>kxt('consentdata');</code> function in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/cross-site-tracking">cross-site tracking</a> scripts now requires a <code>languageName</code> parameter instead of <code>cultureCode</code>. Set the parameter’s value to the code name of the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">language</a> in which you want to load the consent texts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bounced email configuration – When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-email-tracking">configuring bounced email tracking</a> for an SMTP email client, the <code>SoftBounceLimit</code> property is now available in a new <code>BouncedEmailsGlobalOptions</code> options class instead of <code>BouncedEmailsOptions</code>.</li>
<li>Content tree-based routing – The method for enabling the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/routing/content-tree-based-routing">content-tree based routing</a> feature for the application was renamed to <code>UseWebPageRouting</code>.</li>
<li>Cookies
<ul>
<li>The <code>CookieHelper</code> class is now obsolete. To work with cookies, use the newly added, non-static <code>ICookieAccessor</code>. Custom cookie registration is changing as well. Custom cookies now must be registered via the <code>CookieLevelOptions</code> options class on application startup. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/cookies">Cookies</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forms – <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">Forms</a> are now global objects, so the <code>BizFormInfo</code> class no longer contains the <code>FormSiteID</code> property.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/upgrade-to-xperience-by-kentico/editing-components-in-xperience-by-kentico">Legacy MVC selector API</a>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following properties used by the legacy Content selector JavaScript API were renamed:</p>

<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/page-templates-for-page-builder">Page templates</a> – Properties were renamed for <code>PageTemplateDefinition</code>, <code>PageTemplateFilterContext</code> and the <code>RegisterPageTemplate</code> attribute.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="newly-obsolete-api-17" data-section="" data-section-obsolete="">
<h3>Newly obsolete API</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<code>AdminIdentityEmailOptions.DefaultFromAddress</code> – use the <code>SenderAddress</code> property on the same object instead.</li>
<li>
<code>ConsentInfo.GetConsentText</code> – use the new asynchronous <code>ConsentInfo.GetConsentTextAsync</code> method instead.</li>
<li>Cookies
<ul>
<li>
<code>CMS.Helpers.CookieHelper</code> – use <code>Kentico.Web.Mvc.ICookieAccessor</code> instead. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/cookies">Cookies</a> for more information.</li>

<section id="fixed-issues-20" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI authentication</p>
<ul>
<li>An error could occur in special cases when adding a new user in the <em>Users</em> application.</li>
<li>An error occurred if a user attempted to sign in to the administration while being signed in as a <a href="/documentation/business-users/members">member</a> on the live site.</li>
<li>The authentication cookie used for the administration was unnecessarily set in every response to admin UI requests. After the fix, the authentication cookie is valid for 30 minutes (unless the user signs out or the account is disabled).</li>
<li>The hashing algorithm used for admin UI user passwords was enhanced for improved security. Existing user passwords remain compatible, but we recommend that you encourage all users to set new passwords (which will automatically use the new hashing algorithm). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CI/CD</p>
<ul>
<li>An error occurred when restoring <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd">CI/CD</a> data if the changes included a modified module class or content type that had both added and removed fields, with the total number of fields remaining the same.</li>
<li>Changes of the <em>Enable Continuous Integration</em> setting were not applied immediately due to incorrect caching. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Code generators – When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects">generating</a> code for fields with the <em>Media files</em> data type, the corresponding properties in the resulting class incorrectly had the <code>string</code> type instead of <code>IEnumerable&lt;AssetRelatedItem&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact groups – The <em>Recalculate contact group</em> button was displayed as active for users without the <em>Update</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">permission</a> for the <em>Contact groups</em> application (an error occurred if the button was clicked).</p></li>
<li><p>Custom admin UI – The <code>ActionConfigurationExtensions.AddCommandWithConfirmation</code> method’s <code>confirmationDetail</code> parameter was not reflected when configuring custom action buttons for the admin UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Emails – The <em>Send test email</em> button in the <em>Email queue</em> application was incorrectly available for users without the <em>Update</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">permission</a> for the application.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Field editor</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the <em>Data type</em> of an existing field could lead to inconsistent behavior or errors while selecting and configuring a new <em>Form component</em> for the field.</li>
<li>Creating a field with leading or trailing whitespace characters in the <em>Field name</em> caused errors and prevented editing of the field. After the fix, leading or trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed from the <em>Field name</em>.</li>
<li>The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">field editor</a> incorrectly allowed creation of fields with the <em>Required</em> flag enabled, but <em>Display in editing form</em> disabled. This combination of field settings resulted in an error when saving the resulting editing form. Validation was added to prevent this configuration. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Form Builder – It was not possible to add <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-components">form components</a> with identifiers containing certain special characters (for example, <em>acme.date-input</em>) to forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Installation – If the <code>kentico-xperience-dbmanager</code> utility was installed and used without one of the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation">Xperience project templates</a>, errors occurred while attempting to set the database connection string. After the fix, the utlity can handle such scenarios, and create the <code>ConnectionStrings</code> section is the <em>appsettings.json</em> file if it is missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Rich text editor – The <em>Replace image</em> functionality in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a> didn’t work correctly.</p></li>
<li>
<p>UI form components</p>
<ul>
<li>If a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components">form component</a> had a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor/data-type-management">custom data type</a> (registered using <code>DataTypeManager</code>), fields using the component were not displayed in editing forms.</li>
<li>If the <em>Radio button group</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">UI form component</a> was used for a required field, and the form was saved without changing the selected option, the component returned a <em>null</em> value instead of the preset default value.</li>
<li>The <em>Media file selector</em> UI form component could cause performance issues due to loading all files within a folder every time it was opened. After the fix, media files displayed in the selector are cached to improve performance. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Update procedure – Under certain circumstances, the Xperience database <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects">update</a> could end with the following error: “<em>There is already an open DataReader associated with this Connection which must be closed first.</em>”</p></li>

<h3>New features</h3>
<section id="digital-marketing" data-entry="" data-entry-feature="">
<h4>Digital marketing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Emails
<ul>
<li>The system can now track bounces and delivery rates for emails of the <em>Regular</em> type, as well as bounces for individual contacts in recipient lists. This allows you to identify addresses that do not correctly receive emails, which helps keep your recipient lists healthy and protects your sender reputation. For more information, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-email-tracking">Set up email tracking</a> and <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">Send regular emails to subscribers</a>.</li>
<li>Marketers can now manually trigger a <em>Refresh</em> in the <em>Statistics</em> view of emails, which immediately recalculates and displays <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/track-email-statistics">statistics</a> for the given email.</li>
<li>New <em>Unsubscribe rate</em> statistic for <em>Regular</em> emails. Shows the percentage and exact number of recipients who used the email’s unsubscribe link.</li>
<li>New <em>Spam reports</em> statistics for <em>Regular</em> emails, available when using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration">SendGrid</a> to send emails. Shows how many recipients marked the email as spam in their email client.</li>
<li>New <em>Send email</em> permission for the <em>Emails</em> application, which can be assigned to administration user <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">roles</a>. This permission is required to send or schedule <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> of the <em>Regular</em> type. To preserve functionality for existing roles, the update automatically grants the <em>Send email</em> permission to all roles with the <em>Update</em> permission for the <em>Emails</em> application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="updates-and-changes-17" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Emails – Recipient lists for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">regular emails</a> are no longer managed in the <em>Contact groups</em> application. Instead, the new <em>Recipient lists</em> application provides a separate management UI for this purpose.
<ul>
<li>To preserve functionality, the update automatically copies all permissions that existing <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">administration user roles</a> have for the <em>Contact groups</em> application, and grants them for the new <em>Recipient lists</em> application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contact management – The <em>Contact groups</em> and <em>Recipient lists</em> applications no longer allow contacts to be manually removed from the group or list. The option to remove contacts was misleading – the contact list is recalculated automatically based on the contact group’s condition or managed by subscriptions and unsubscriptions for recipient lists.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-24" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Database – The system persisted incorrect <em>Info</em> object state in its cache in cases where a database transaction failed and was rolled back. For example, if a database transaction updating a <em>MediaFileInfo</em> object failed, the database state was not updated, but the updated state persisted in the system cache. This lead to data inconsistency between the application and the database, and could cause a subsequent <em>Get</em> operation to obtain incorrect data (when retrieved from the system cache).</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – Scrolling did not work correctly in the <em>Page selector</em> editing component dialog when using the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/upgrade-to-xperience-by-kentico/editing-components-in-xperience-by-kentico">compatibility mode</a> of Page Builder.</p></li>
<li><p>Rich text editor – On administration pages containing multiple <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">Rich text editor</a> components, certain toolbar options (<em>Insert image</em>, <em>Insert link</em>, <em>Insert Dynamic Text</em>, <em>Insert Double Opt-In Link</em>) didn’t work correctly and could interact with the wrong instance of the editor. The issue could also affect custom plugins registered for the rich text editor. If you have custom plugins, review the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/rich-text-editor-configuration/rich-text-editor-plugins">updated documentation</a> and make sure your plugins are registered correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>UI form components – Selecting content items via the <em>Content item selector</em> component resulted in duplicate selection if the checkbox was used to select individual items.</p></li>

<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Object types – The hotfix removes the ability to define <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">object type fields</a> of the <em>Pages</em> and <em>Content items</em> data types. Fields of these data types were incorrectly available to object type classes for a brief period, but their support was never intended. Note that already created object type classes making use of these data types remain unaffected. However, the system is not prepared to handle them correctly, and certain features, such as code generators, produce incorrect results. This change does not impact <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content types</a> in any way.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">UI form components – It wasn’t possible to enter values consisting only of zeros (e.g., ‘00.0’) into numeric inputs, such as the Number input <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">form component</a>.</span></p></li>

<h3>Fixed issues – security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Xperience Portal – Under certain circumstances, there was a risk an unauthorized third party could access and download backups of projects deployed in the SaaS environment.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-26" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Administration – In certain cases, it was possible to submit values using disabled fields in the administration’s editing forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Content types – If the <em>Display in editing form</em> option was enabled in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">field editor</a> for a content type field with the <em>Content items</em> data type, an error occurred when configuring further properties for the field’s form component.</p></li>
<li><p>Deployment – Sites <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-private-cloud/deploy-without-the-administration">deployed without the administration</a> crashed during the startup process (“Unable to resolve service for type <code>Kentico.PageBuilder.Web.Mvc.Internal.IComponentPropertiesStorageProcessor</code>“ exception).</p></li>
<li><p>Digital marketing – Various usability improvements were made in the UI of the <em>Emails</em>, <em>Email templates</em> and <em>Contact groups</em> applications.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Emails</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new friendly warning to inform users when attempting to send a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">regular email</a> to an empty recipient list.</li>
<li>Improved UI and explanation texts for emails that were sent, but do not have any logged statistics.</li>
<li>Pressing CTRLF while focused in the <em>Source code</em> editor of email templates triggered the editor’s built-in search functionality, which was not intended. After applying the refresh, the browser’s standard “Find in page” functionality is prioritized.</li>
<li>Some parts of the email UI remained active even if the overall editing interface was disabled, e.g., due to missing update permissions or when viewing a regular emails that was already sent out. For example, the problem affected the editing dialog for double opt-in links in form autoresponder emails, the email <em>Plain text</em> content editor, and certain header action buttons.</li>
<li>The content editor of form autoresponder emails displayed the placeholder for double opt-in links incorrectly if the link’s text contained special characters.</li>
<li>The editing dialog for double opt-in links in form autoresponder <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> didn’t check for unsaved changes. After applying the refresh, a confirmation prompt is displayed when attempting to close the dialog with a modified link text or recipient list. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Modules – Field settings related to data type integrity were not validated correctly in the editor for the UI forms of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">module classes</a>. For example, the problem allowed invalid values for the number of digits and decimal places of <em>Decimal number</em> type fields in UI forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – Images added using the <code>url()</code> CSS function in the <em>Code View</em> mode of the <em>Rich text</em> widget’s editor were not displayed on the live site or in the Page Builder.</p></li>
<li><p>Project templates – When creating a SaaS environment <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment">deployment package</a> for a project based on the Dancing Goat project template, <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">content item</a> asset files were incorrectly duplicated in the package (in both the standard asset folder and the Continuous Deployment repository). After the refresh, SaaS deployment packages created for new Dancing Goat project no longer include the <em>~/assets</em> folder.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Rich text editor</p>
<ul>
<li>If the rich text editor had a custom <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/rich-text-editor-configuration">toolbar configuration</a> with the <code>imageReplace</code> button, the button displayed a default Froala dialog instead of the system’s dialog for selecting images.</li>
<li>Inserting of links in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">rich text editor</a> didn’t work correctly in certain cases in the <em>Content</em> view mode of the <em>Pages</em> and <em>Emails</em> applications.</li>
<li>On administration UI pages with a right-side panel, the panel didn’t close correctly if the user interacted with the rich text editor toolbar on the main editing page. For example, the problem could occur when editing emails in the <em>Emails</em> application.</li>
<li>The <em>Insert image</em> and <em>Insert link</em> dialogs in the rich text editor displayed the <em>Media library</em> selection tab even if there were no media libraries present in the system.</li>
<li>The rich text editor <em>Insert image</em> and <em>Insert link</em> dialogs did not work correctly when the rich text component was used to edit the property of a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-components">form component</a> in the Form Builder.</li>
<li>When selecting a link to a page or content item in the rich text editor, the full toolbar was incorrectly displayed instead of just the link-related toolbar options. </li>

<h3>Breaking changes – API</h3>

<ul>
<li>Application startup – <code>IFeaturesBuilder</code> interface members <code>BeforeConfiguration</code>  and <code>AfterConfiguration</code> were not intended to be used in custom code and were removed from the public API. <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/website-development-basics/configure-new-projects/enable-application-features">Extension methods for this interface</a> (e.g., <code>UsePageBuilder</code> ) are used to add types required by various Xperience features into the application’s <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/website-development-basics/dependency-injection">IoC container</a>.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-27" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Added missing spacing to certain selection dialogs.</li>
<li>Disabled editing forms in the administration (e.g. due to missing <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">update permissions</a>) behaved inconsistently in certain cases. After applying the refresh, disabled editing forms always contain a warning message and have a disabled <em>Save</em> button with a tooltip.</li>
<li>The administration UI breadcrumbs didn’t correctly shorten text for objects with very long names. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CI/CD</p>
<ul>
<li>If an object was deleted, but the operation was stopped due to the existence of depending objects, the files representing the object and its dependencies in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> repository were removed even though the object was not actually deleted.</li>
<li>The XML files representing contact groups of the <em>Recipient list</em> type in the CI/CD repository incorrectly used 0 or 1 values for the <em>ContactGroupIsRecipientList</em> boolean property, which could cause inconsistencies. After applying the refresh, the property stores <em>True</em> or <em>False</em> values. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Contact groups – When viewing the details of <em>Recipient list</em> contact groups, text in the <em>Approval</em> and <em>Unsubscribe settings</em> areas could overflow when viewed with a small display width.</p></li>
<li><p>Content types – When adding a new content type field with the <em>Content item</em> selector form component, the <em>Allowed content type</em> option could not be configured until the field was saved.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-site tracking – Certain requests returned during <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/cross-site-tracking">cross-site tracking</a> used an incorrect <code>X-Frames-Options</code> header. This combination of the header and its value is now deprecated in modern browsers. After applying the refresh, the <code>content-security-policy</code> header is used for this purpose.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Emails</p>
<ul>
<li>If the application crashed or was stopped while sending a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">regular email</a> to recipients, the mailout remained stuck and didn’t recover after the application restarted.</li>
<li>If the send date or time of a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">regular email</a> was changed in the <em>Reschedule</em> dialog and the sendout was then cancelled, the dialog was not refreshed correctly and the <em>Cancel scheduled sendout</em> button remained visible.</li>
<li>The <em>Preview</em> mode of emails incorrectly allowed links in the email content to be clicked, which could lead to inconsistent behavior. After applying the refresh, links are no longer active when clicked in the email <em>Preview</em>.</li>
<li>The system created redundant anonymous <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management">contacts</a> in certain cases when a user confirmed their <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">email subscription</a> by clicking a double opt-in link. For example, this could occur if the recipient opened the double opt-in link in a different browser than the one where the original subscription form was submitted. After applying the refresh, such anonymous contacts are automatically merged into the recipient’s main contact. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Performance – The number of database queries called when loading the content of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/widgets-for-page-builder">Page Builder widgets</a> was optimized. The original performance issue occurred after updating to version 24.0.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Project templates – The sample site created by the <em>Dancing Goat</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation">project template</a> didn’t correctly handle situations where certain content items were deleted, which could result in errors on the live site.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Role management</p>
<ul>
<li>If a user with the <em>Administrator</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">role</a> unassigned this role from their own account, an <em>Access denied</em> notification was displayed even though the operation was valid and the role was unassigned.</li>
<li>When using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/administration-registration-and-authentication/administration-external-authentication">external authentication for the administration</a> with the user synchronization frequency set to <code>UserSynchronizationFrequency.Always</code>, users with the <em>Administrator</em> role were incorrectly allowed to edit the role assignments of users managed by the external authentication provider. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI form components</p>
<ul>
<li>Fields based on certain form components did not display their tooltip (e.g. the <em>Page selector</em> or <em>Content item selector</em>).</li>
<li>Fields based on the <em>Number input</em> form component incorrectly displayed <em>null</em> as their value when the value was empty.</li>
<li>If a field based on the <em>Object selector</em> had a large number of items available and a value was already selected, the list of items loaded and displayed the first batch of items twice.</li>
<li>If a field based on the <em>Radio group component</em> did not have a label assigned, the resulting UI page generated warnings in the browser console. For example, the problem occurred in the <em>Review and send</em> dialog for emails in the administration. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Xperience Portal – The <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role did not have access to the <em>Outages</em> application in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal">Xperience Portal</a>.</p></li>

<h4>Content management</h4>
<ul>
<li>Content item assets – <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets">Content item assets</a> are a new type of content items that allow content editors to upload and store various types of files, for example, photos, pictures, sound files, videos, package files, presentations, or documents. You can reuse assets stored in the <em>Content hub</em> throughout the system. To create a new content item asset, create a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types">content type</a> with an <em>Content item asset</em> field.</li>
<li>Content item selector – Users are now able to select content items from the <a href="/documentation/business-users/content-hub">content hub</a> in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">component properties</a>.</li>

<section id="digital-marketing-4" data-entry="" data-entry-feature="">
<h4>Digital marketing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Emails
<ul>
<li>New functionality that allows marketers to send regular emails to groups of recipients. Visitors subscribe by submitting a form on the website. The form sends an autoresponder email with a double opt-in link, through which recipients finish the subscription process. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers">Send regular emails to subscribers</a>.</li>
<li>The system now tracks and displays statistics for <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> created in the <em>Email templates</em> and <em>Emails</em> applications, including the number of sent emails, email opens and clicked links. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/track-email-statistics">Track email statistics</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forms – Users can now edit the <em>Code name</em> of <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms">forms</a>, which allows developers to work with more practical identifiers, e.g., when rendering forms in code as <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/render-widgets-in-code">stand-alone widgets</a>.
<ul>
<li>Changes of the form code name break existing forms placed onto pages via the <em>Form</em> widget. You need to reselect the form in these widgets after making such changes.</li>
<li>Changing the code name also automatically updates the form’s <em>Class name</em>. Such changes break existing code files <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects">generated</a> for the form, and developers need to update or regenerate the code.</li>

<h4>API</h4>
<ul>
<li>New <em>CMS.EmailEngine.ISmtpClientFactory</em> API that enables developers to modify the configuration of the system’s SMTP client (if using SMPT servers for mailout). This API is primarily intended for advanced environments with specific requirements.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="general-1" data-entry="" data-entry-update="">
<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rich text editor – The ability to drag-and-drop content into the rich text editor UI form component was disabled. Use your operating system’s clipboard functionality instead.</li>
<li>Emails – The “Preheader” property of <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> was renamed to “Preview text”. The corresponding placeholder in the source code of email templates is now <em>$$previewtext$$</em>. Applying the refresh automatically updates the placeholder in the source code of existing email templates.</li>
<li>Admin UI customization – <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages">UI pages</a> for creating new objects (inheriting from the base class) no longer validate the editing form when the <em>Change</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-page-commands">UI page command</a> is executed. This prevents unnecessary validation errors while filling in parts of the create form.</li>

<section id="object-types" data-entry="" data-entry-update="">
<h4>Object types</h4>
<p>This release changes the way <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types#configure-code-generation-for-data-classes">hash table caching</a> for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">object types</a> is configured. In previous versions, the caching was configured by passing the <code>HashtableSettings</code> object via an optional constructor parameter to the object type’s <em>I*InfoProvider</em> implementation:</p>

<div>

<div>
<span>C#</span>

<strong>Hash table caching configuration using the provider class</strong>
</div>
<div>
<button>
<span></span><span></span> <span>Copy</span>
</button>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<pre><code>

[ProviderInterface(typeof(IMyObjectTypeInfoProvider))]
public partial class MyObjectTypeInfoProvider : AbstractInfoProvider&lt;MyObjectTypeInfo, MyObjectTypeInfoProvider&gt;, IMyObjectTypeInfoProvider
{
    public MyObjectTypeInfoProvider()
            : base(MyObjectTypeInfo.TYPEINFO,
                   new HashtableSettings
                        {
                            // Enables hash table caching over the identifier and code name
                            ID = true,
                            Name = true
                        }
                   )
    {
    }
}

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>From this version onward, this approach and the corresponding <em>*InfoProvider</em> constructor are obsolete. Instead, the caching is configured directly in the <em>*Info</em> data class via the <code>InfoCache</code> attribute:</p>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<span>C#</span>
</div>
<strong>Hash table caching configuration via the Info data class</strong>
</div>
<div>
<button>
<span></span><span></span> <span>Copy</span>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<pre><code>

[InfoCache(InfoCacheBy.ID | InfoCacheBy.Name)]
public partial class MyObjectTypeInfo : AbstractInfo&lt;MyObjectTypeInfo, IMyObjectTypeInfoProvider&gt;
{
}

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you are using hash table caching for custom object types, there are two ways to migrate to the new approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Regenerate all custom object type classes using the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects">code generator</a>, which automatically ensures the new format. However, note that this will also require you to manually transfer all customizations made to the object type’s classes.</li>
<li>Manually convert custom object type classes to the new approach:
<ol type="1">
<li>Remove the <code>HashtableSettings</code> parameter from the <em>*InfoProvider</em> constructor.</li>
<li>Annotate the corresponding <em>*Info</em> class with the <code>InfoCache</code> attribute.
<ol type="1">
<li>Use the <code>InfoCacheBy</code> enum to determine the properties to cache by.</li>
<li>(Optional) Use the <code>InfoCachePriority</code> enum to configure whether the cached items should expire.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="content-hashes-in-admin-ui-script-filenames" data-entry="" data-entry-update="">
<h4>Content hashes in admin UI script filenames</h4>
<p>The file names of script files consumed by the Xperience admin UI now include a content hash (e.g., <em>kentico.xperience.admin.app.entry.kxh.<strong>adf398f7ffd6e16a4961</strong>.js</em>) This change ensures that script files cached on the client are correctly invalidated when updating to a new version. In previous versions, the client browser usually defaulted to cached scripts even if the file contents were different, requiring users to refresh the browser cache (CtrlF5) to get the latest version (or wait for cache expiration).</p>
<p>All newly created custom admin UI modules (see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/prepare-your-environment-for-admin-development">Prepare your environment for admin development</a>) automatically include content hashing. However, if your admin UI consumes any existing custom modules, and you wish to make use of the content hashing feature, you need to make the following changes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Update all <em>@kentico</em> packages to 24.0.0.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Open the <em>webpack.config.js</em> of your module and follow the comments in the following snippet:</p>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<span>JS</span>
</div>
<strong>webpack.config.js</strong>
</div>
<div>
<button>
<span></span><span></span> <span>Copy</span>

<div>
<pre><code>

 const webpackMerge = require("webpack-merge");

 const baseWebpackConfig = require("@kentico/xperience-webpack-config");

 module.exports = (opts, argv) =&gt; {
   // Add the 'argv' parameter to the arrow function signature
   const baseConfig = (webpackConfigEnv, argv) =&gt; {
     return baseWebpackConfig({
       orgName: "acme",
       projectName: "web-admin",

         {
           test: /\.(js|ts)x?$/,
           exclude: [/node_modules/],
           loader: "babel-loader",
         },
       ],
     },
     // Add the output-clean:true setting

       clean: true
     },
     devServer: {

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>
<section id="changes-to-assembly-placement-in-nuget-packages" data-entry="" data-entry-breaking="">
<h4>Changes to assembly placement in NuGet packages</h4>
<p>The <em>CMS.AspNetCore.Platform</em> assembly was moved from <em>Kentico.Xperience.Core</em> to the <em>Kentico.Xperience.WebApp</em> NuGet package and renamed to <em>Kentico.AspNetCore.Platform</em>.</p>
<p>For web applications, this change in not breaking – <em>Kentico.Xperience.Web.App</em> depends on the <em>Kentico.Xperience.Core</em> package.</p>
<p>However, for <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/use-the-xperience-by-kentico-api-externally">other types of applications</a> (e.g., console or desktop applications), there is a possibility that your custom code called some code from the moved assembly.

<h3>Breaking changes – API</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>UserInfo.Enabled</code> property was fully removed, use <code>UserInfo.UserEnabled</code> instead.</li>
<li>The following members were removed from the content management API:
<ul>
<li>
<code>IPageTypeFieldsProvider</code>  – use <code>IContentTypeFieldsProvider</code> instead.</li>
<li>
<code>IPageTypeFieldsProviderFactory</code> – if this interface was used as a dependency, replace usages with <code>IContentTypeFieldsProvider</code> directly. The additional layer of abstraction introduced by the factory was removed completely.</li>
<li>
<code>PageType</code> – there is no alternative. Implement a custom class to replace.</li>
<li>
<code>LoadAvailablePageTypesResult</code> – there is no alternative. Implement a custom class to replace.</li>
<li>
<code>LoadAvailablePageTypesCommandArguments</code> – there is no alternative. Implement a custom class to replace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>PageFormSubmissionPageBase</code>  – the constructor now depends on <code>IContentTypeFieldsProvider</code> directly.</li>
<li>The <code>CMS.AspNetCore.Platform</code> namespace was renamed to <code>Kentico.AspNetCore.Platform</code> (also includes all subnamespaces).</li>
</ul>

<section id="fixed-issues-28" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>API</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling the <code>IPageDataContextRetriever.TryRetrieve</code> method resulted in an unhandled exception if the page data context could not be initialized, instead of returning a false value.</li>
<li>Conventional MVC mechanism such as <code>AuthorizeAttribute</code> now work with the admin UI <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">role-based access control model</a> for routes registered behind <code>/admin</code>.</li>
<li>Exceptions caused by cancelling asynchronous operations via cancellation tokens – as a response to a cancelled client request or application shutdown, for example – were incorrectly logged to the event log as errors (e.g., as <code>System.OperationCancelledException</code>).</li>
<li>The API documentation for the <code>WithPageUrlPaths</code> DocumentQuery extension method was improved with additional remarks regarding the method usage. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop-down menus now close during a click-away action that targets an iframe with either the Page Builder, Form Builder, or page preview window.</li>
<li>Fixed the vertical alignment of button labels in the Safari browser.</li>
<li>For certain elements the ‘element is now focused’ blue border indicator was partially obscured or was rendered incorrectly.</li>
<li>Implemented responsive drop-down menus that automatically adjust based on viewport and parent element width.</li>
<li>Opening a drop-down list in a component properties dialog sometimes caused the drop-down menu to overflow the dialog window.</li>
<li>The application menu now overlays menus and panels that open from the right side of the interface (e.g., selector dialogs in the <em>Pages</em> application, configuration options in the <em>Forms</em> application) on displays where smaller viewport width causes overlaps.</li>
<li>The confirmation dialog displayed when changing page templates now uses the same look and feel as other dialog windows in the admin UI.</li>
<li>The listing pages context menu, available via (…), was obscured by the listing container in special cases.</li>
<li>The primary action button was not by default focused in interactive dialogs. Now, the primary action is always performed on enter (save, delete, confirm, etc.). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Content hub – Content items listed in the content hub are now by default ordered according to the <em>Last modified</em> column.</p></li>
<li><p>Content items – It was incorrectly possible to delete linked content items from “locked” pages that were in the published or archived workflow state.</p></li>
<li><p>Form Builder – Fixed various text overflow issues that could occur when entering long words in form component properties.</p></li>
<li>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized the number of database queries required when checking <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management">user permissions</a> in the admin UI.</li>
<li>The Readme.txt file in the <em>Dancing Goat</em> and <em>Boilerplate</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation">project templates</a> contained an invalid link to the documentation. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Headless API – Fixed issues caused by the tilda ‘<em>~</em>’ character in asset filenames.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules – When creating fields for module classes via the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">field editor</a>, the <em>Field name</em> length wasn’t validated correctly by the UI, and very long values could result in an error.</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – If Cross-Site Request Forgery validation failed when submitting a form generated by the <em>Form</em> Page Builder widget, a “Cannot read property of null” error was logged in the browser console in addition to the expected HTTP 400 error code.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Pages</p>
<ul>
<li>Page URL slugs and other text longer than the width of the various page property dialogs (<em>Information</em>, <em>URL</em>) now break into multiple lines instead of disappearing past the browser window when longer than the available viewport space.</li>
<li>The content tree in the Pages application now better indicates possible placement when dragging and dropping pages.</li>
<li>The design and appearance of certain elements in the content tree was updated to better match the admin UI look and feel.</li>
<li>When changing page URL slugs on the <em>URL</em> tab in the <em>Pages</em> application, entering slugs longer than the width of the dialog window caused the input to stretch past the browser window.</li>
<li>When drag and dropping pages, the dragged pages are now hidden from their original position in the content tree instead of showing both at the original position and on the mouse cursor, possibly confusing users.</li>
<li>When moving items with children via the content tree, the confirmation prompt for the move operation did not appear in certain cases.</li>
<li>When saving page URL slugs on the <em>URL</em> tab in the <em>Pages</em> application, the Save button now transitions to a disabled state to prevent multiple concurrent requests from being submitted. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI form components</p>
<ul>
<li>It was not possible to view more than the first 150 files in a selected media library via the <em>Media file selector</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">UI form component</a>.</li>
<li>It was possible to clear a selection made using the <em>Object selector</em> even if the field was marked as required.</li>
<li>Pages selected within the <em>Page selector</em> form component cast a shadow incorrectly when dragged.</li>
<li>Selecting a month or year in the <em>DateTime input</em> form component incorrectly saved the whole form.</li>
<li>The <code>MinimumDecimalValueValidationRule</code> and <code>MaximumDecimalValueValidationRule</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-validation-rules#assign-validation-rules-using-attributes">validation rule attributes</a> could not be used because the attribute constructor did not allow the <em>decimal</em> type as a valid attribute parameter type. The attribute constructors now accept <em>double</em> instead. Conversion to decimal is done by rounding to 15 significant digits using rounding to nearest (a limitation of the <em>double</em> input type).</li>
<li>When the <em>Object selector</em> was placed in a side panel, selecting any action inside the selector caused the side panel to collapse. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unix/Linux – Instances hosted in Linux environments could encounter exceptions when accessing resources from <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/files-api-and-cms-io/file-system-providers/amazon-s3">Amazon S3</a>. This would occur, for example, when accessing media library files stored in Amazon S3.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Xperience Portal</p>
<ul>
<li>A JavaScript error was logged in the browser console when viewing the <em>hash string salt</em> value (<em>Dashboard</em> → <em>Project</em> <em>info</em> section) on displays with certain viewport widths.</li>
<li>A wrong type of error page was displayed for Not Found (HTTP 404) and other HTTP errors.</li>
<li>The <em>Outages</em> application in <em>Xperience Portal</em> only displayed project outage reports starting from the beginning of the month following the project deployment. For example, projects deployed 8/15/2022 could only view reports starting from 9/1/2022.</li>
<li>The deployments page may not have displayed correctly during an ongoing maintenance.</li>
<li>The format of the <em>Account created</em> and <em>User added to project</em> email notifications was not correct in case the first name of the user was unknown.</li>
<li>The project expiration date displayed on the <em>Dashboard</em> in <em>Xperience Portal</em> incorrectly included the 30 day grace period for license renewals. </li>

<li>During <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/website-development-basics/configure-new-projects">application startup</a>, the system no longer automatically adds services related to session state and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to the service collection. Specifically, the <code>IServiceCollection.AddKentico</code> call no longer includes the following:

<li>
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.sessionservicecollectionextensions.addsession" target="_blank">AddSession</a> – if you wish to utilize session state in your code, you need to manually <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/app-state#configure-session-state" target="_blank">Configure session state</a> (add the required services and middleware components).</li>
<li>
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors" target="_blank">AddCors</a> – to avoid potential errors, remove the <code>UseCors</code> call from your application’s middleware components. If you wish to use CORS, you need to manually <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors" target="_blank">Enable Cross-Origin Requests</a>.</li>

<section id="fixed-issues-29" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Admin UI – Several minor issues with alignment, font size, spacing and shadows were fixed in the administration interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact groups – Validation error messages in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact group</a> condition builder were duplicated when an invalid condition was submitted multiple times.</p></li>
<li><p>Emails – The <em>Preheader</em> field in the <em>Properties</em> of <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> was missing a tooltip.</p></li>
<li><p>Event log – The system’s <a href="/api/development/event-log">event logging API</a> was not thread-safe, causing, e.g., <code>Parallel.ForEach</code> calls that logged information into the event log to incorrectly terminate with an exception.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Forms</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting a form with an enabled autoresponder didn’t remove the internal automation process used to send the autoresponder emails.</li>
<li>Fields with very long label text were displayed incorrectly in the Form Builder interface.</li>
<li>Horizontal scrollbars were displayed for fields in the Form Builder interface in certain cases on devices with a small display width.</li>
<li>If the form selected in a <em>Form</em> widget was later deleted, the widget’s configuration dialog displayed errors.</li>
<li>Multiple clicks of a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">form’s</a> submit button in quick succession could cause the system to send multiple autoresponder emails. After the update, clicked submit buttons are disabled until the request is processed.</li>
<li>Multiple clicks of action buttons in the options panel of the form administration UI could trigger multiple requests. After the update, a loading button is displayed after a click until the request is processed.</li>
<li>The <em>Country</em> and <em>State</em> contact attributes were not available for mapping when configuring form fields. After the update, mapping to these attributes is supported for <em>Text</em> and <em>Number</em> fields. Text fields attempt to map country or state code name values, number fields work with country or state IDs.</li>
<li>The Form Builder interface displayed checkboxes with incorrect alignment in certain cases for <em>Checkboxes</em> fields.</li>
<li>The autoresponder options in the <em>After form submission</em> panel of the <em>Forms</em> application were not disabled correctly if the form was modified so that it no longer contained a field mapped to the <em>Email</em> contact attribute. The autoresponder options now need to be manually reconfigured if a properly mapped Email field is returned to the form. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media libraries</p>
<ul>
<li>When <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-content-from-media-libraries">resizing images</a> retrieved from media libraries, the image encoding quality was set to 100%, which could cause resized images to be larger in file size than the original. After the update, the default encoding quality is set to 80%.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp" target="_blank">WebP images</a> uploaded to media libraries were stored and served with the wrong MIME type, and were not displayed correctly on the website.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-retrieval/retrieve-content-from-media-libraries">Getting the URL of a media file</a> using the <code>IMediaFileUrlRetriever.Retrieve</code> API always generated the file’s <code>DirectPath</code> URL, even when it was not required or used. When storing media files on Azure storage, this resulted in unnecessary requests to Azure. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Page Builder – Page, Path, Media and Attachment selectors for the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/upgrade-to-xperience-by-kentico/editing-components-in-xperience-by-kentico">Page Builder legacy compatibility mode</a> did not preserve any order of the selected items. After applying the update, the items are stored in the order in which they were selected.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Pages</p>
<ul>
<li>After attempting to save a conflicting <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls">URL slug</a> for a page in the Pages application, the resulting error message disappeared immediately.</li>
<li>Fixed minor design issues in the <em>Change template</em> dialog in the <em>Pages</em> application, and added a Friendly warning with additional information. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI form components</p>
<ul>
<li>Entering a very long number into the <em>Number input</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">form component</a> caused the value to be converted to scientific notation. After the update, only numbers between -2147483647 and 2147483647 can be entered.</li>
<li>Fields in the administration with a selector form component (e.g., <em>Dropdown selector</em>) did not save their value in special scenarios. The problem occurred if the field used a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-visibility-conditions">visibility condition</a>, and also had an assigned <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/editing-components/configure-editing-component-state">configurator</a> that dynamically populated the selection options.</li>
<li>If the <em>Rich text editor</em> had a custom <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/rich-text-editor-configuration">toolbar configuration</a> with the <code>toolbarInline</code> option disabled, enabling the <code>toolbarSticky</code> option didn’t work. The toolbar didn’t remain displayed at the top of the editing area when scrolling down in the content. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Xperience Portal – An error was logged to the browser console when selecting or clearing the checkbox for confirming DNS settings in the <em>Site domains</em> or <em>SendGrid domains</em> applications within Xperience Portal.</p></li>

<p>Email management – When creating <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">emails</a> in the <em>Email templates</em> and <em>Emails</em> applications, editors can specify the following new options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain text content – Improves deliverability of emails. Some recipients may prefer plain text emails, and certain email clients only accept plain text.</li>
<li>Email preheader – The brief text that recipients see in their inbox after the email sender information and the subject line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Xperience Portal – SaaS deployment uptime monitoring is now available in Xperience Portal. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal">Uptime monitoring</a>.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Administration UI development
<ul>
<li>Properties within configuration dialogs of admin UI, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a>, and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder">Form Builder</a> components now support <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-visibility-conditions">multiple visibility conditions</a>.</li>
<li>Added the option to dynamically configure the state of <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/editing-components">editing components</a> assigned to properties in admin UI, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder</a>, and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder">Form Builder</a> configuration dialogs. The configuration can run on the initial load of the properties dialog or when the value of another field within the dialog changes. A typical use case are selector components (drop-down, radio buttons), whose selection changes based on the value of a different property in the dialog. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/editing-components/configure-editing-component-state">Configure editing component state</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Forms – The listing in the <em>Forms</em> application contains a new column indicating whether the autoresponder is enabled for each form.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Contact groups – When viewing the contacts belonging to a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact group</a> in the <em>Contact groups</em> application, users can now select contacts to open the given profile in the <em>Contact management</em> application.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The <em>Text area</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">UI form component</a> for the administration provides new properties that allow configuration of the area’s minimum and maximum displayed height (number of rows).</li>

<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rich text editor – When registering <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/rich-text-editor-configuration">Rich text editor configurations</a>, a display name needs to be specified for the configuration.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">Field editor</a> – Updated the names of certain field configuration options to better describe their purpose (<em>Tooltip text</em> and <em>Text below the input</em>).</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-30" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>An accessibility warning was logged in the browser console when viewing administration pages containing the <em>Password</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">UI form component</a> (e.g., on the sign-in or change password page).</li>
<li>Dialogs and side panels (e.g., the options panel in the <em>Forms</em> application) incorrectly closed after the user performed certain actions outside of the dialog area, for example mouse wheel clicks or right-clicks. After applying the update, dialogs are only closed by primary interactions, i.e., left mouse button clicks.</li>
<li>Minor improvements of the administration interface were made, for example increased font size for certain text.</li>
<li>The <em>Icon selector</em> form component was not disabled correctly, e.g., when viewing the editing form of a published or archived page.</li>
<li>The layout of the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms">Form Builder</a> designer area was broken on devices with a small display width.</li>
<li>When creating or editing fields in the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">Field editor</a>, multiple scrollbars appeared in certain cases.</li>
<li>When displaying selected pages in an administration UI form, the <em>Page selector</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">component</a> incorrectly showed the published name of <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">pages</a>, even when a newer version (draft) of the page had a different name. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Emails – Selecting the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">email</a> name in the administration UI’s breadcrumbs incorrectly opened the email preview instead of the content editing view.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Forms</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>After form submission</em> panel in the <em>Forms</em> application became broken and displayed an error if an email selected for the Autoresponder was later deleted.</li>
<li>The email selector in the <em>After form submission</em> panel incorrectly remained enabled even if the form didn’t contain a field mapped to the <em>Email</em> contact attribute. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Running on a time zone with a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset" target="_blank">UTC offset</a> caused unhandled errors in certain scenarios. For example, such errors could occur when logging event log records or when executing unit tests.</li>
<li>The system had a dependency on the deprecated <em>Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Ajax</em> package. The Page and Form Builder scripts no longer use the <em>jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js</em> bundle, and the dependency was removed. The related <code>FormBuilderBundlesOptions.JQueryUnobtrusiveAjaxCustomBundleWebRootPath</code> property in the API is now obsolete.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">Domain aliases</a> of sites were not validated correctly and allowed duplicate domain name values for the same site.</li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/field-editor">Field editor</a> – Values entered into the <em>Default value</em> of fields were not validated in certain cases, and validation messages were displayed incorrectly. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Project templates – The sample site created by the Dancing Goat project template contained several broken links to non existing pages.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Routing</p>
<ul>
<li>If the page specified in <em>Settings → URLs and SEO → Home page</em> was deleted, the <em>Pages</em> application didn’t work and an error occurred.</li>
<li>The routing engine was vulnerable to CRLF Injection when performing redirects due to improper encoding of the URL query string. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Emails – When viewing the details of emails via the <em>Email detail</em> dialog in the <em>Email queue</em> application, labels identifying individual email properties displayed unresolved resource strings instead of the corresponding property names.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Site domain aliases – It was not possible to register a domain name or alias starting with the <em>www.</em> prefix. This made it impossible to generate absolute URLs with the <em>www.</em> prefix to content managed by the system, as the URL generation API always prepended the URL with the site’s domain name, which resulted in URLs such as <em>https://mydomain.com/landing</em>. After applying the hotfix, domain names starting with <em>www.</em> are allowed. Moreover, the hotfix fixes an issue that allowed users to register multiple identical domain aliases for a single domain.</span></p></li>

<h2>Refresh (September 8, 2022)</h2>
<p><strong>version 22.2.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-32" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Object type management and customization</strong><br>
Introduced a new <em>Modules</em> application with the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for creating and registering <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">object types</a> into the system. Object types contain metadata that describe the properties and behavior of database entities integrated into and leveraging certain Xperience features.</li>
<li>Support for extending system object types.</li>
<li>Support for entering <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/macro-expressions">macro expressions</a>. Until now, macro expressions were used by the system in the background, but were not available to users. Currently, macros are usable when configuring the default values of object type fields via the <em>Modules</em> application.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>New email management applications</strong><br>
New <em>Email templates</em> and <em>Emails</em> applications that allow users to prepare and edit the content of emails directly in the Xperience administration. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">Emails</a> for more information. Currently, such emails can only be used with <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms">form autoresponders</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Xperience Portal</strong><br>
Custom site domains and the SendGrid sender domain can now be assigned through Xperience Portal. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#website-channels-in-the-saas-environment">Domain names for SaaS deployment</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration#sendgrid-integration">SendGrid integration</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Disqus integration</strong><br>
Xperience offers an external module that integrates with the <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a> comment platform. The module contains a <em>Disqus comments</em> widget that provides the option to add a comment section to any page on your website. Disqus also offers advanced moderation tools, analytics and monetization options. The module is distributed as a NuGet package. For more information and detailed instructions, see the <a href="https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-disqus/tree/xbk" target="_blank">Xperience by Kentico Disqus Widget</a> GitHub repository.</p>


<p><strong>Code editor UI form component</strong><br>
New <em>Code editor</em> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">UI form component</a> for the administration. Provides a text editing area suitable for code, with support for syntax highlighting and line numbers.</p>

</section>
<section id="updates-and-changes-23" data-section="" data-section-update="">
<h3>Updates and changes</h3>

<p>The original <em>Emails</em> application in the Xperience administration was renamed to <em>Email queue</em>. The new <em>Emails</em> application is now used to manage the content of emails. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails">Emails</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-31" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain inputs and selectors displayed incorrectly when they contained a very long text value.</li>
<li>Certain locations in the administration displayed unresolved resource string keys instead of the actual text (for example the descriptions of event log records related to page workflow status changes).</li>
<li>Error messages displayed when attempting to delete an object with existing dependencies did not accurately describe the cause of the problem. For example, such errors occurred when deleting a page type with existing pages in the content tree.</li>
<li>The explanation text for the Password component was not displayed correctly in some locations.</li>
<li>When navigating between pages in listings within the administration, the screen didn’t scroll to the top of the page content.</li>
<li>When working in a dialog within the Xperience administration, notifications and error messages were incorrectly displayed outside of the dialog in certain cases. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Contact groups – The object selectors in <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact group</a> conditions were misaligned in certain cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Forms – The <em>General</em> or <em>After form submission</em> options panel in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms">form editing interface</a> was not hidden correctly after clicking into the Form Builder editing area.</p></li>
<li><p>General – After performing a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects">project update</a>, the system didn’t correctly detect differences in the minor and hotfix version number of the database and project packages. The application now fails to start and returns an error on startup when such a version difference is detected. You always need to update both project packages and the database when performing an update.</p></li>
<li><p>Installation – When running the <code>dotnet kentico-xperience-dbmanager</code> CLI command with the <code>--recreate-existing-database</code> parameter, the database configuration was not preserved in certain scenarios (for example for Azure SQL databases).</p></li>
<li><p>Page Builder – Fixed minor vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Page Builder scripts.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Page types</p>
<ul>
<li>After deleting a field in the <em>Field editor</em> within the <em>Page types</em> application, the configuration of the deleted field was incorrectly displayed instead of the values of the next field, which the field editor automatically expands.</li>
<li>The label text of the save button in the <em>Field editor</em> within the <em>Page types</em> application was unified to “Save”. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting a page while editing another one prevented notifications about unsaved changes from being displayed.</li>
<li>Notifications about unsaved changes were not displayed correctly in the <em>Pages</em> application when attempting to move the page or its parent. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Rich text editor – When using the <em>Code View</em> of the <a href="/documentation/business-users/rich-text-editor">Rich text editor</a> to edit page content in the <em>Pages</em> application, changes were lost after saving the page. After applying the refresh, the editor automatically switches to the default WYSIWYG view after clicking anywhere outside of the editor area, including the page’s <em>Save</em> button, and changes are saved correctly.</p></li>

<h2>Refresh (August 12, 2022)</h2>
<p><strong>version 22.1.0</strong></p>
<section id="new-features-33" data-section="" data-section-feature="">
<h3>New features</h3>

<p><strong>Minimal APIs support</strong><br>
The system now supports application configuration using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis" target="_blank">minimal APIs</a> introduced in .NET 6.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation">Project templates</a> from the <em>Kentico.Xperience.Templates</em> NuGet package were updated – newly created projects leverage the minimal API configuration model by default.</li>
<li>The legacy configuration model with separate program entry (<em>Program.cs</em>) and startup files (<em>Startup.cs</em> by default) remains fully supported, but its use is no longer recommended. All documentation and training materials now work with minimal APIs exclusively. To migrate your codebase to the new model, follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60-samples" target="_blank">Migrate to the new minimal hosting model in ASP.NET Core 6.0</a> for framework code, and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/website-development-basics/configure-new-projects">Configure new projects</a> for Xperience-related code.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Page templates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page templates can now be configured using <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/page-templates-for-page-builder/page-template-properties">custom properties</a>.</li>
<li>Pages created using page templates that contain Page Builder content (widgets, sections) can now be saved as <em>Preset templates</em> and reused when creating other pages. Templates prepared by the developers (added via <code>RegisterPageTemplate</code>) are now referred to as <em>Default templates</em>. See <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/page-templates">Page templates</a>.</li>
<li>When changing the <em>Default</em> page template of a page, users now have the option to transfer existing Page Builder content over from the current page, assuming editable areas in both the source and target template use matching identifiers. See the <em>Implement page templates section</em> on <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/page-templates-for-page-builder">Page templates for Page Builder</a> for developer documentation, and the <em>Change templates of existing pages</em> section on <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/page-templates">Page templates</a> for business documentation.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Xperience Portal</strong><br>
The hash string salt value assigned to Xperience Portal projects is now visible in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#hash-string-salt-for-the-xperience-portal-project">Xperience Portal</a>, under the <em>Project info</em> section of the project <em>Dashboard</em>. Previously, hash string salts were provided by Kentico alongside Xperience Portal projects using other channels.</p>


<p><strong>Administration interface</strong><br>
The Xperience administration now uses an appropriately-themed dialog window when notifying users about interactive events (e.g., notifications about unsaved changes), instead of each browser’s default notification system.</p>

</section>
<section id="fixed-issues-32" data-section="" data-section-issue="">
<h3>Fixed issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Admin UI customization – The <code>BarItemGroup</code> component (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kentico/xperience-admin-components" target="_blank">@kentico/xperience-admin-components</a>) generated the “Each child in a list should have a unique ‘key’ prop” warning in the browser console, for example when using the field editor in the <em>Page types</em> application.</p></li>
<li>
<p>CI/CD</p>
<ul>
<li>CI/CD commands returned a non-zero exit code in special cases even if the result was successful.</li>
<li>If the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> command-line tools were run targeting a directory without a <em>repository.config</em> file, the processes got stuck and could only be terminated using a hard exit (CtrlC). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Contact groups – Attempting to close the contact group condition dialog with unsaved changes now displays a warning prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-site tracking – The <em>Website name</em> column in the listing of tracked websites under <em>Cross-site tracking</em> <em>→ Tracked websites</em> incorrectly displayed the tracked site’s code name instead of its display name.</p></li>
<li><p>Former URLs – Moving a page via drag-and-drop using the content tree in the <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content">Pages</a> application incorrectly created a <a href="/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls">former URL</a> for the page even when the page’s URL was not affected by the move operation (e.g., a reorder within the same section of the tree).</p></li>
<li><p>Forms – The Form Builder interface could be displayed on different domains via an iframe (assuming certain conditions were met).</p></li>
<li><p>General – Minor visual issues that could in certain cases appear throughout the administration interface across various browsers (listings and search inputs overflowing on smaller resolutions, incorrect shadows on certain elements, minor layout issues on specific pages, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Licensing – License expiration notifications were displayed incorrectly in certain cases.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Pages</p>
<ul>
<li>After a page was moved in the content tree in the <em>Pages</em> application, the right-side workspace was not updated and could incorrectly display outdated information (e.g., a page’s URL still reflected the previous position).</li>
<li>After discarding changes to a page in the <em>Pages</em> application, certain fields on the <em>Content</em> tab were not reverted to their previous values (not displayed correctly from the last published or archived version of the page).</li>
<li>When editing a page’s URL slug via <em>Properties</em> in the <em>Pages</em> application, the <em>Publish change</em> button could disappear in rare cases.</li>
<li>When editing a page’s URL slug via <em>Properties</em> in the <em>Pages</em> application, the caption of the save button now reflects the workflow state of the page – <em>Publish change</em> for published pages, and <em>Save change</em> for unpublished or archived pages. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Project templates – When running the Dancing Goat project in Kestrel on Linux environments, accessing certain malformed images caused a complete shut down of the Kestrel hosting process, requiring a full application restart. The affected images were replaced. This change only applies to new projects created after updating the <em>Kentico.Xperience.Templates</em> NuGet package to version 22.1.0 or newer.</p></li>
<li>
<p>UI form components</p>
<ul>
<li>Text inside disabled Text area and Text input <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components">UI form components</a> was not visible when using the Safari browser.</li>
<li>The Form Builder interface could be displayed on different domains via an iframe (assuming certain conditions were met).</li>
<li>The URL selector UI form component could under certain circumstances lose focus unexpectedly when manually editing its value.</li>
<li>The clickable area of checkbox components in the administration was increased.</li>
<li>The object selector UI form component didn’t reflect the <code>Tooltip</code> and <code>InactiveMessage</code> properties.</li>
<li>The system incorrectly evaluated <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/ui-form-component-visibility-conditions">UI form component visibility conditions</a> that made use of transitive dependencies. In these cases, the system failed to correctly reflect the values of certain fields based on their (in)visibility when evaluating the condition, which could result in incorrect visibility states. For example, assume field dependencies A → B → C, which implies that field C also depends on field A. Setting A to a value that hides B must also hide C (due to transitivity), which was not the case. After applying the fix, complex visibility conditions that depend on hidden fields use either the hidden field’s default value (if set) or an empty value. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xperience Portal</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal">Xperience Portal</a> <em>Deployments</em> application, the <em>Deploy to</em> drop-down for selecting the target environment was incorrectly enabled even where there was no existing deployment in the source environment.</li>
<li>The expiration date of the license key generated via the <em>License key generator</em> application in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal">Xperience Portal</a> can no longer be manually specified. License key expiration is now automatically managed by the portal – all generated keys are set to expire together with the validity of your Xperience subscription.</li>
<li>The link to the License Key Generator on the Xperience Portal Dashboard didn’t work.</li>
<li>Xperience Portal password reset emails did not contain a password reset link if the user’s email address included uppercase characters. </li>

<h3>Hotfix (August 5, 2022)</h3>
<p><strong>version 22.0.4</strong></p>

<p>New features</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-entry="" data-entry-feature="">Cross-site tracking – Functions in cross-site tracking scripts now provide an optional <code>onerror</code> callback, which allows custom handling for scenarios where cookies are blocked, as well as other error states. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/cross-site-tracking">Cross-site tracking</a>.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Cross-site tracking – Adding or revoking consent agreements using the <code>kxt('consentagree', ...);</code> and <code>kxt('consentrevoke', ...);</code> functions in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/cross-site-tracking">cross-site tracking</a> scripts incorrectly created an anonymous contact when the client’s browser blocked third-party cookies. In these cases, the contact was unnecessary and never contained any data, since tracking is not possible even if the visitor gives consent.</span></li>

<h3>Hotfix (July 29, 2022)</h3>
<p><strong>version 22.0.3</strong></p>

<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-entry data-entry-issue>Cross-site tracking
<ul>
<li>Checking the consent status of the current contact using the <code>kxt('consentcontactstatus', ...);</code> call in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/cross-site-tracking">cross-site tracking</a> scripts incorrectly created a new anonymous contact in cases where the visitor had not given consent to be tracked.</li>
<li>When a visitor accepted tracking consent on an external website, and then arrived on the main Xperience site, the system failed to detect the consent and didn’t automatically set an appropriate cookie level for the main site. After applying the hotfix, the cookie level specified during application startup via <code>CrossSiteTrackingOptions</code> is set automatically for tracked visitors from external sites, and the cross-site contact is merged with the contact representing the visitor on the main site. </li>
</ul></span></li>

<p><strong>version 22.0.2</strong></p>

<h3>Hotfix (July 15, 2022)</h3>
<p><strong>version 22.0.1</strong></p>

<p>Fixed issues</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Contact groups – The recalculation warning displayed after editing a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups">contact group’s condition</a> behaved incorrectly. In certain cases, clicking the button didn’t immediately display the “loading” status, and the warning remained visible even after recalculation was triggered and successfully finished.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Cross-site tracking – When using the default configuration, the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/cross-site-tracking">cross-site tracking</a> scripts attempted to reach a non-existing <code>Kentico.CrossSiteTracking/Logger/LogCrossSiteAnalytics</code> endpoint. This caused failed requests on the tracked site’s pages.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Forms – If validation failed for the <em>Email</em> or <em>U.S. phone number</em> fields when submitting a <a href="/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms">form</a>, the validation error messages were displayed incorrectly (as unresolved resource string keys).</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Licensing – The administration incorrectly displayed license expiration notifications when using an evaluation license. After applying the hotfix, expiration notifications only appear for full licenses.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span data-entry="" data-entry-issue="">Project templates – The <em>Privacy</em> page on the Dancing Goat sample site (<code>kentico-xperience-sample-mvc</code> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation">project template</a>) displayed an error if the data protection demo was not enabled in the <em>Sample data generator</em> application. The hotfix does not update existing sites, only new projects created based on the Dancing Goat template.</span></p></li>
